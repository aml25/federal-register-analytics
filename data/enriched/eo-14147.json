      "The review process could politicize the Department of Justice and Intelligence Community by focusing on one administration's actions while ignoring others.",
      "Potential overreach or broad reinterpretation of what constitutes 'weaponization' could chill legitimate law enforcement and intelligence activities.",
      "Document retention and compliance enforcement could lead to internal conflicts or litigation within agencies.",
      "Lack of clear enforcement mechanisms or timelines may reduce the effectiveness of accountability measures.",
      "Critics might see the order as undermining prosecutorial independence or interfering with ongoing criminal investigations."
