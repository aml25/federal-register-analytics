    "summary": "This executive order declares a national emergency in response to actions by the Government of Brazil that threaten U.S. national security, economy, and free expression rights. To address these threats, it imposes a 40% tariff on certain Brazilian imports and authorizes U.S. officials to take further measures if needed.",

      "The 40% tariff may increase costs for U.S. consumers and businesses relying on Brazilian goods.",

      "Censorship-related allegations could complicate diplomatic relations and provoke political backlash.",
      "Implementation and enforcement of the tariff and emergency measures could create administrative burdens for customs and trade agencies.",
      "The broad scope of the order may risk unintended economic impacts beyond the targeted sectors or companies."
