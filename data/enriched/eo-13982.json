    "summary": "This executive order directs the Department of Defense to study possible toxic exposures experienced by U.S. military members who served at an air base in Uzbekistan from 2001 to 2005, and for the Department of Veterans Affairs to consider recognizing these veterans as having served in a combat zone. The goal is to better understand health risks and ensure appropriate care and benefits for affected veterans.",

      "Recognizing veterans as having served in a combat zone based on these findings could have budgetary and policy implications that generate debate.",
      "Implementation may face challenges due to coordination between Defense and Veterans Affairs departments."
