    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to make criminal regulations clearer and to limit criminal penalties to those who knowingly violate rules, helping protect Americans from unfair criminal punishment for accidental infractions. It also requires agencies to be transparent about when violations can lead to criminal charges and encourages administrative enforcement instead of criminal prosecution for strict liability offenses.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The requirement for explicit mens rea language might slow down regulatory rulemaking or lead to legal challenges.",
      "Agencies might inconsistently apply discretion on referrals to criminal prosecution, causing uneven enforcement.",
      "Strict liability offenses may still be pursued administratively in ways that could impose significant penalties without criminal safeguards.",
      "The policy might limit enforcement flexibility in complex cases where intent is difficult to prove but harm is serious.",
      "Balancing transparency with operational security or sensitive investigations could create tension or implementation difficulties."
