    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to restore trust in government science by ensuring all federally funded research is transparent, rigorous, reproducible, and free from bias or conflicts of interest. It mandates clear policies for scientific integrity, openness of data and models, acknowledgment of uncertainties, and unbiased peer review to improve public confidence and the quality of science guiding government decisions.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Strict adherence to reproducibility and transparency requirements could delay or complicate urgent scientific work or policymaking in fast-moving crises.",
      "The subjective evaluation of what constitutes ‘gold standard’ science might lead to politicization or selective acceptance of scientific evidence.",
      "Reverting policies from prior administrations may disrupt ongoing initiatives incorporating diversity, equity, and inclusion in science, potentially causing internal agency conflicts.",
      "Requirements to publicly disclose data and models could raise confidentiality, national security, or proprietary concerns that are difficult to balance.",
      "Enforcement delegated to senior appointees may lead to inconsistent application or potential internal agency disputes over scientific disagreements."
