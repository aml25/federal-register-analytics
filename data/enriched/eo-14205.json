      "The increased emphasis on faith-based organizations receiving federal funding could raise concerns about favoritism or the blurring of church-state separation.",
      "Secular public institutions and advocates for strict church-state separation may feel marginalized or face challenges due to expanded religious exemptions and accommodations.",
      "Implementation might result in inconsistent enforcement or interpretation of religious liberty protections across agencies.",
      "Efforts to reduce burdens on religious exercise could potentially undermine nondiscrimination protections in programs receiving federal funds.",
      "The creation of an office with broad authority to influence federal policy could raise concerns about undue political influence over diverse community organizations."
