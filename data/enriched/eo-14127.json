    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to coordinate efforts to combat new firearms threats such as untraceable 3D-printed guns and machinegun conversion devices, and to improve school-based active-shooter drills by developing research-backed guidance that minimizes trauma and ensures inclusivity. It establishes a Task Force to assess risks and create strategies for interagency collaboration on emerging firearms dangers, and directs the development of federal resources to help schools implement safer, age-appropriate, and legally compliant drills.",

      "Efforts to regulate 3D printer technology could inadvertently restrict legitimate uses and innovation in additive manufacturing.",
      "Increased enforcement against untraceable firearms and conversion devices may escalate legal challenges or push illicit activities further underground.",
      "The lack of clear evidence-based best practices for active-shooter drills risks adoption of ineffective or potentially harmful drill methods.",
      "Schools may face burdens or costs implementing new guidelines, especially smaller or under-resourced districts.",
      "Privacy and civil liberties concerns may arise from increased surveillance and data-sharing between law enforcement agencies regarding firearms threats."
