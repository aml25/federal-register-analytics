    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to review and eliminate regulations that are unconstitutional, exceed their authority, or impose undue burdens, especially on small businesses and innovation. It promotes focusing enforcement only on regulations clearly supported by law and requires new regulations to undergo more stringent evaluation to prevent overreach. The goal is to reduce government regulatory burden and restore constitutional limits on federal power.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Reducing enforcement of certain regulations may limit protections for public safety, consumer rights, and the environment.",
      "The broad criteria for rescinding regulations could lead to inconsistent or politicized application across agencies.",
      "Small businesses might benefit from reduced burdens but could also lose protections previously afforded by some regulations.",
      "The expansive definition of enforcement discretion risks legal challenges and confusion over which regulations remain enforceable.",
      "Exemptions for national security and immigration may create uncertainty about which rules apply, complicating agency compliance."
