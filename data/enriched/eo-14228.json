    "summary": "This executive order increases tariffs on certain products imported from China to 20 percent to address the ongoing threat posed by synthetic opioids, like fentanyl, originating there. It reflects a determination that China has not taken sufficient actions to reduce the flow of these drugs into the United States, continuing to threaten national security and the economy.",

      "Potential adverse impact on U.S.-China diplomatic relations beyond trade and drug enforcement issues.",
      "Risk that targeting an entire product category may harm legitimate trade and economic interests unrelated to opioids."
