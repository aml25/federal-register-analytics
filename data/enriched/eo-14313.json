      "The Commission’s inclusion of multiple agencies could cause coordination challenges or conflicting priorities.",
      "Efforts to restore access for hunting, fishing, and off-road activities may generate conflicts with other conservation goals or indigenous land rights.",
      "Addressing large deferred maintenance needs without guaranteed appropriations could limit the effectiveness of the order’s implementation."
