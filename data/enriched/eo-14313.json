      "Prioritizing voluntary conservation and reduced oversight might weaken protections for endangered species and ecosystems.",
      "The Commission’s inclusion of multiple agencies could cause coordination challenges or conflicting priorities.",
      "Efforts to restore access for hunting, fishing, and off-road activities may generate conflicts with other conservation goals or indigenous land rights.",
      "Addressing large deferred maintenance needs without guaranteed appropriations could limit the effectiveness of the order’s implementation."
