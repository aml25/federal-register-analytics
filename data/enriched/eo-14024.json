      "Sanctions may unintentionally impact innocent individuals or businesses with indirect ties to designated persons, causing economic disruption.",

      "Restrictions on entry may raise concerns about due process or diplomatic retaliation from allied governments.",
      "Overly broad definitions of prohibited activities risk capturing legitimate technological or commercial activities, potentially harming U.S.-Russia economic engagement where not intended.",
      "The order could increase geopolitical tensions and provoke retaliatory measures from the Russian Federation, complicating diplomatic relations."
