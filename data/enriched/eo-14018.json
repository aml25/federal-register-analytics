      "Revoking multiple prior executive actions may cause temporary uncertainty or confusion within federal agencies about current policies and procedures.",

      "Some stakeholders may oppose the revocation of actions intended to address poverty, economic regulation, or democratic accountability, viewing it as a rollback of policy priorities.",
      "The broad language may lead to disagreements about the scope of what should be rescinded or abolished, complicating agency compliance efforts.",
      "Eliminating entities and reversing policies could disrupt ongoing programs or initiatives that depend on these prior orders."
