    "potential_concerns": [
      "The ban on transactions with certain Chinese software could lead to retaliation or escalation in economic and technological conflict with China.",
      "The order may be challenging to enforce effectively due to the widespread use of mobile applications and the complexity of tracking indirect transactions.",
      "There could be negative impacts on users who rely on these applications for legitimate purposes, including businesses and individuals.",
      "Implementation relies heavily on interagency coordination which could delay timely updates to the prohibited list of software.",
      "The order may raise questions about due process and the criteria used to designate apps as national security risks."
