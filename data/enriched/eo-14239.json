    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to empower state, local, and individual efforts to improve preparedness and resilience of U.S. infrastructure against risks like cyberattacks, natural disasters, and other hazards. It requires the development and regular updating of national strategies and policies to better coordinate investments, streamline federal operations, and enhance communication between different levels of government to protect communities and reduce taxpayer costs.",

      "The shift from an all-hazards approach to a risk-informed approach could overlook less likely but still critical threats.",
      "Coordination challenges between federal, state, and local entities may delay effective implementation or create gaps in preparedness.",
      "The focus on empowering state and local governments may lead to uneven preparedness capabilities across regions due to varying resources and expertise.",
      "Streamlining preparedness policies risks oversimplifying complex threats or reducing safeguards previously embedded in older policies.",
      "The absence of policies addressing misinformation and cognitive infrastructure in this order may create regulatory gaps in handling information threats."
