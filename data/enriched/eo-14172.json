      "The order may marginalize or conflict with indigenous place names and cultural heritage, particularly impacting Alaska Native groups.",
      "Restoring Mount McKinley's name might alienate or offend groups who support the prior name Denali, reflecting cultural and historical disagreements.",
      "Implementation challenges include coordinating multiple federal agencies, updating databases, maps, and federal documents consistently within the 30-day deadlines.",
      "Potential public backlash or confusion may arise from sudden changes to widely recognized geographic names impacting tourism, education, and local identity."
