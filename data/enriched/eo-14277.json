      "The order relies heavily on coordination across multiple agencies and private partners, which may result in slow or uneven implementation.",
      "There may be disparities in access to AI education and resources, potentially widening educational gaps between well-funded and under-resourced communities.",
      "Rapid integration of AI in classrooms without adequate educator training could lead to ineffective or superficial AI instruction.",
      "Emphasis on AI skills could inadvertently de-prioritize other essential areas of education if not balanced carefully.",
      "Privacy and ethical concerns related to deploying AI technologies broadly in educational settings are not addressed in the order."
