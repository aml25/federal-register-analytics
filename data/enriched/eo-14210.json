    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to reduce the size of the federal workforce by hiring only one new employee for every four departures, except in public safety, immigration enforcement, or law enforcement roles. It requires agencies to identify and eliminate nonessential functions and initiate workforce reductions while expanding criteria for suitability in federal employment. The order aims to increase government efficiency by cutting waste and bureaucracy while requiring agency reorganization and ongoing reporting.",

      "Large-scale workforce reductions could harm employee morale and disrupt critical agency functions.",
      "Increased suitability criteria may lead to arbitrary or overly broad disqualifications of federal job candidates.",
      "Exemptions granted by agency heads could result in inconsistent application and potential politicization of hiring and firing.",
      "Eliminating non-mandated functions may disproportionately impact diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and other social programs.",
      "The aggressive hiring freeze risks understaffing essential government functions, potentially reducing service quality or response times."
