    "summary": "This executive order aims to reduce unnecessary criminal penalties within federal regulations by requiring agencies to clearly identify which rules carry criminal consequences and to favor civil enforcement over criminal prosecution except in cases where intentional wrongdoing is evident. It promotes transparency by mandating agencies to publish reports listing criminal regulatory offenses, clarify the mental state required for violations, and discourage strict liability offenses to protect ordinary Americans from unknowingly becoming criminals.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The determination of which offenses warrant criminal enforcement versus civil enforcement could be inconsistently applied across agencies, leading to confusion or uneven protections.",
      "Strict liability offenses are discouraged but not eliminated, potentially allowing some individuals to still be criminally liable without proven intent.",
      "Requiring agencies to publish and update detailed reports may create administrative burdens and delays in regulatory processes.",
      "Focusing criminal prosecutions only on those who knowingly violate regulations could reduce enforcement deterrence for certain harmful but unintentional violations.",
      "There may be tension between the order’s reforms and agency statutory authorities, complicating implementation across diverse regulatory areas."
