      "Suspension of entry could hinder engagement with reform-minded individuals critical to regional stability efforts.",
      "Enforcement requires complex interagency coordination which could delay implementation or lead to inconsistent application.",
      "Lack of transparency in listings and delistings might raise legal and due process concerns for affected persons."
