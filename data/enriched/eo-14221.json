      "Increased regulatory enforcement may raise compliance costs for hospitals and insurers, potentially leading to higher administrative overhead.",
      "Incomplete or inaccurate price disclosures could persist if enforcement mechanisms are insufficient or if providers manipulate data.",
      "Hospitals and health plans might struggle to standardize and compare prices effectively, causing patient confusion instead of clarity.",
      "Pharmaceutical companies might push back against public disclosure of true drug prices, possibly affecting drug market dynamics.",
      "There may be challenges ensuring that price transparency actually translates into lower costs and better patient outcomes rather than just more data."
