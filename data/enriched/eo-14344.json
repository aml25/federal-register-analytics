    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to prioritize traditional and classical architecture in the design of federal public buildings, aiming to make these buildings more beautiful, dignified, and reflective of American civic values. It requires the General Services Administration to update its policies, emphasize classical design experience in selecting architects, and involve local input to ensure federal buildings better serve and inspire the public.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "This order could limit architectural innovation and diversity by strongly favoring classical and traditional styles over modern designs.",
      "Local architectural preferences might be overlooked outside the District of Columbia, despite the stated goal of regional respect.",
      "Requiring classical design experience may reduce the pool of qualified architects, potentially increasing costs or delaying projects.",
      "The subjective criteria of 'beauty' and 'dignity' might lead to inconsistent or politicized application of the order.",
      "Additional administrative requirements, such as notifications to the President and new hiring standards, could slow project approvals and increase bureaucratic complexity."
