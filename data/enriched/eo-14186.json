      "The rapid development and deployment of advanced missile defense technology may lead to significant budgetary pressures and competition for resources within the Department of Defense.",
      "Increased reliance on space-based interceptors and sensors raises concerns about the vulnerability of space assets to attack or interference.",
      "Heightened focus on missile defense could escalate arms races or tensions with peer and near-peer adversaries.",
      "Implementation challenges might arise from coordinating with allies and partners who have differing technological capabilities and strategic interests.",
      "The order lacks explicit safeguards related to civil oversight and transparency in deployment decisions, which could raise accountability issues."
