    "summary": "This executive order directs the U.S. government to strengthen protections for Americans wrongfully detained abroad by allowing the Secretary of State to designate countries responsible for such detentions as State Sponsors of Wrongful Detention. It outlines possible government responses like sanctions, travel restrictions, and export controls against those designated countries, aiming to deter wrongful detention and hold foreign governments accountable.",

      "Designation of countries as State Sponsors of Wrongful Detention may escalate diplomatic tensions and lead to retaliatory measures against U.S. interests abroad.",
      "Sanctions and travel restrictions could inadvertently harm innocent civilians or businesses in designated countries, worsening humanitarian conditions.",
      "Determining and proving 'wrongful detention' under the Levinson Act may be legally and factually complex, leading to inconsistent application.",
      "Coordinating enforcement across multiple agencies involves significant administrative challenges and may delay timely responses to wrongful detentions.",
      "Critics may argue the order risks politicizing hostage and detention issues, potentially complicating negotiations and diplomatic resolutions."
