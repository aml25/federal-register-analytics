    "summary": "This executive order directs the U.S. government to designate international cartels and violent transnational organizations like MS-13 as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists. It aims to treat these groups as national security threats and take aggressive actions to disrupt their operations, including legal and immigration measures, to protect the safety and security of the United States.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Designating cartels and transnational gangs as terrorist organizations may complicate traditional law enforcement efforts and create legal challenges.",
      "The designation could lead to increased violence or retaliation by these groups in affected communities, including those near the U.S. border.",
      "Implementation requires coordination across multiple agencies, which may delay or hinder immediate operational effectiveness.",
      "There is risk of straining diplomatic relations with neighboring countries, especially Mexico, due to cross-border enforcement and sovereignty concerns.",
      "The broad application of immigration enforcement provisions could adversely affect the rights and due process of individuals accused or affiliated with these groups."
