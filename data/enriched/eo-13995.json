      "Equity-focused modifications to pandemic response could be politicized or resisted by some agencies or local governments.",
      "The diverse and broad membership of the Task Force may slow decision-making and complicate consensus building.",
      "Communities with multiple overlapping vulnerabilities might still be underserved if data intersectionality is not adequately addressed."
