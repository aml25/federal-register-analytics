    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to prioritize restoring public safety by targeting homelessness linked with substance abuse and mental illness, encouraging civil commitment where appropriate, and shifting federal funding away from programs it views as ineffective such as 'housing first' or harm reduction. It also calls for stricter enforcement of laws against vagrancy, drug use, and unauthorized camping, along with increased accountability for homelessness assistance programs to ensure public order and safety.",

      "Greater law enforcement involvement in homelessness issues may result in criminalizing poverty and exacerbate community tensions.",
      "Implementation may be hindered by legal challenges to reversing judicial precedents and terminating consent decrees protecting rights.",
      "There is risk of inadequate resources to ensure quality care in expanded institutional settings leading to poor outcomes."
