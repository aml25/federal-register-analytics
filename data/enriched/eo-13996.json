    "summary": "This executive order creates a COVID-19 Pandemic Testing Board to coordinate and expand COVID-19 testing efforts across the federal government, supports making testing widely available and free for uninsured individuals, and establishes a program to build a sustainable public health workforce to respond to COVID-19 and future biological threats. It also directs agencies to improve testing access in priority populations and high-risk settings and to develop plans for long-term public health workforce capacity.",
