      "Secondary ticket markets might find ways to circumvent rules, continuing consumer harm despite enforcement.",
      "Collaboration between federal and state agencies may face jurisdictional or resource coordination obstacles.",
      "The order lacks specific mechanisms to involve consumer advocacy groups or create permanent oversight structures."
