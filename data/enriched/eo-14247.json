    "summary": "This executive order directs the federal government to stop using paper checks and money orders for all payments and receipts and to switch to electronic payment methods, like direct deposits and digital wallets, by September 30, 2025. It seeks to reduce costs, speed up payments, prevent fraud, and protect against mail theft, while allowing limited exceptions for those who cannot access electronic payment systems.",
