    "potential_concerns": [
      "The order’s directive to redirect funds previously allocated for services to illegal aliens to veteran programs may provoke interagency conflicts and legal challenges regarding funding use.",
      "Restoring accountability by reversing rehiring decisions and redirecting savings could face resistance from unionized VA employees and legal disputes.",
      "Ensuring effective coordination among multiple federal agencies and local municipalities for homeless veteran support may prove operationally challenging and slow.",
      "The ambitious goal to house up to 6,000 homeless veterans by 2028 may be difficult to achieve given the scale of homelessness and resource constraints in Los Angeles and nationwide.",
      "Increased use of vouchers and expansion of healthcare services could face budgetary limitations and require sustained congressional support for appropriations."
