It emphasizes treating all individuals with equal dignity without consideration of DEI factors and mandates reviews and reporting on the costs and impacts of prior DEI-related programs.",

      "The order may reduce efforts to address systemic discrimination and inequities within federal employment and programs, negatively affecting diversity and inclusion progress.",
      "Removing DEI-related training and initiatives could harm workplace culture and employee morale, particularly for minority and marginalized groups.",
      "Federal contractors and grantees who rely on DEI requirements may face operational disruptions or loss of funding.",
      "Monitoring and enforcing the prohibition of DEI considerations might be challenging and could lead to inconsistent implementation across agencies.",
      "Critics may argue the order undermines civil rights protections by labeling DEI efforts as discriminatory and wasteful."
