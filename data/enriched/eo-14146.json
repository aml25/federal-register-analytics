    "summary": "This executive order partially revokes several sections of a previous order on federal mission resilience, reorganizing and amending certain provisions to update federal continuity governance. It replaces some committees with new security policy committees and clarifies that the order does not affect legal authorities or create enforceable rights.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The revocation and restructuring of continuity governance provisions could lead to temporary confusion or gaps in federal mission resilience coordination.",
      "Replacing established committees with new ones may delay decision-making during critical national security situations as roles and responsibilities transition.",
      "The order’s language could be seen as reducing transparency or oversight by removing certain executive committees without clear public explanation.",
      "Implementation timing and allocation of appropriations may challenge consistent application across federal agencies.",
      "Lack of detail on how amended provisions will operate in practice might result in inconsistent interpretations across departments."
