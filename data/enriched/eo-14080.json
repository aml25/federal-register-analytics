      "Ensuring effective coordination among multiple federal agencies and stakeholders could be challenging and may slow implementation.",
      "The focus on reducing dependence on foreign supply chains, particularly from China, may increase geopolitical tensions or provoke retaliatory measures.",
      "Allocating resources equitably to support minority-owned, veteran-owned, and disadvantaged communities may face implementation or oversight difficulties.",
      "Protecting taxpayer funds through strong compliance and accountability may require robust monitoring systems that can be complex to establish.",
      "Rapid technological advancements could outpace policy adaptations, risking gaps in sustaining long-term U.S. leadership in microelectronics."
