      "Higher domestic content standards might limit flexibility to source specialized materials or technology internationally.",
      "Smaller or less competitive American suppliers may struggle to meet the new standards without adequate support.",
      "Transparency requirements could expose sensitive information or create risks if not carefully balanced with national security concerns."
