    "summary": "This executive order bans the import of key Russian energy products into the United States and prohibits new U.S. investments in Russia's energy sector. It aims to punish Russia for its aggression against Ukraine by cutting off economic support connected to its energy industry. The order also blocks any U.S. involvement in transactions facilitating these prohibited investments or imports.",

      "The import bans could increase U.S. energy prices and contribute to global energy market volatility.",
      "Restricted investments may limit U.S. economic engagement options and complicate enforcement across international jurisdictions.",
      "There is a risk of evasion through third-party countries or entities that may undermine the effectiveness of the prohibitions.",
      "The sanctions could provoke retaliatory measures from Russia impacting U.S. businesses and geopolitical stability.",
      "Implementation requires robust coordination and monitoring, which may strain resources and slow response to circumvention attempts."
