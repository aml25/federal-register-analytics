      "The 18-month temporary organization timeline may create uncertainty about the continuity and long-term sustainability of modernization efforts.",
      "Agencies may face hiring and resource challenges to form DOGE Teams within thirty days, potentially delaying implementation.",
      "Displacement of prior executive orders and regulations could cause legal ambiguity and resistance within agencies accustomed to previous rules."
