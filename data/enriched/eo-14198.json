    "summary": "This executive order pauses the planned 25 percent tariffs on certain Mexican products in response to Mexico's efforts to combat illegal migration and drug trafficking. It directs U.S. officials to continue monitoring the situation and reserves the right to reinstate tariffs if Mexico's actions prove insufficient to address these issues.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Pausing the tariffs may reduce short-term economic pressure on Mexico but could weaken leverage to enforce sustained border security and anti-trafficking cooperation.",
      "If Mexico fails to take sufficient actions during the pause, reinstating tariffs quickly could disrupt trade and supply chains.",
      "The order could increase tensions between the U.S. and Mexico if perceived as coercive or punitive despite cooperative efforts.",
      "The impacted industries and workers in the United States and Mexico may face uncertainty due to the conditional and temporary nature of the tariff pause.",
      "Effectiveness depends heavily on interagency coordination and timely, accurate assessment of Mexico's actions, which may be challenging."
