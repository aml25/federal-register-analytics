    "summary": "This executive order imposes a 25% tariff on goods imported into the United States from any country that imports Venezuelan oil, either directly or indirectly, as a measure to penalize support for the Maduro regime and to address national security threats posed by Venezuela and the Tren de Aragua gang. It authorizes key Cabinet officials to determine which countries are subject to these tariffs and to enforce and administer the related measures starting April 2, 2025.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The order may provoke trade retaliation from countries affected by the tariffs, escalating international trade tensions.",
      "Determining indirect Venezuelan oil imports through third parties may involve complex enforcement challenges and risk inconsistent application.",
      "The tariffs could increase costs for U.S. importers and consumers, potentially impacting domestic prices and supply chains.",
      "Countries and companies attempting to evade tariffs through transshipment or reclassification may undermine the policy’s effectiveness.",
      "Targeting China and its special administrative regions could strain diplomatic relations and complicate broader U.S.-China economic engagement."
