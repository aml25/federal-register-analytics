    "summary": "This executive order encourages the United States Postal Service (USPS) to strengthen and align its domestic procurement policies with federal 'Buy American' requirements by giving preference to American-made goods in its purchasing decisions. It asks USPS to consider updating its rules to increase the price advantage of American products and clarify rules about foreign materials to support using more U.S.-produced goods.",

      "Stronger Buy American preferences could increase USPS procurement costs, potentially affecting operational budgets or service prices.",
      "Implementation challenges might arise in correctly determining domestic content percentages and applying price differentials consistently.",
      "Tighter Buy American rules could limit USPS access to certain foreign-made products that may be lower cost or higher quality.",
      "Potential conflicts could occur between USPS policies and broader Department of Transportation or federal acquisition regulations.",
      "There may be limited flexibility for USPS to respond to supply chain disruptions if strict domestic sourcing is required."
