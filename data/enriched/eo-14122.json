It revokes earlier COVID-19-related executive orders and terminates certain coordinator positions, aiming to streamline and improve coordination across government agencies on pandemic and biological threat policies.",

      "Terminating the COVID-19 Response Coordinator position may cause temporary gaps in leadership or accountability during the transition to OPPR.",
      "Consolidation of responsibilities into OPPR could overwhelm the office with duties, potentially reducing responsiveness or effectiveness.",
      "Revoking earlier COVID-19 orders may eliminate certain targeted protections or measures prematurely if new structures do not fully replicate prior functions.",
      "Displaced federal workers from terminated positions may face job loss or uncertainty without clear transition plans.",
      "Coordination among diverse agencies could be challenging under a single office, risking bureaucratic delays or interagency conflict."
