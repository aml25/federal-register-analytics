    "summary": "This executive order establishes a White House Initiative to improve educational equity, excellence, and economic opportunities for Hispanic and Latino students and communities from early childhood through their careers. It creates an interagency working group and advisory commission to coordinate federal efforts, promote best practices, and address disparities worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department of Education will lead these efforts with support from many federal agencies to ensure Hispanic and Latino students have better access to quality education and career pathways.",

      "Measuring and ensuring the effectiveness of multiple federal agencies’ coordinated efforts may prove challenging and lead to inconsistent progress.",
      "There is a risk that the focus on Hispanic and Latino students might be perceived as exclusionary or lead to tensions with other minority groups seeking similar equity initiatives.",
      "Agencies may face resource constraints that limit their ability to implement comprehensive action plans without additional appropriations.",
      "The advisory commission’s membership selection process might lead to underrepresentation of certain Hispanic community subgroups or geographic areas.",
      "Ensuring that new programs fully address intersectional barriers faced by subpopulations such as LGBTQ+ students, students with disabilities, and migrant learners may be difficult."
