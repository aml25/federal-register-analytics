    "summary": "This executive order adjusts which agricultural products are excluded from reciprocal tariffs previously imposed to address U.S. trade deficits. It exempts certain agricultural goods from these tariffs starting November 13, 2025, to reflect updated trade negotiations, domestic demand, and production capacity, while continuing to manage the national emergency related to trade imbalances.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Removing tariffs on certain agricultural products could increase competition for U.S. farmers and agricultural workers, potentially threatening their livelihoods.",
      "There may be challenges in monitoring and enforcing the updated scope of tariff exclusions effectively across importers and customs agents.",
      "Critics might argue that exempting agricultural products weakens the original intent of the tariffs to reduce trade deficits and protect domestic industry.",
      "Adjusting tariffs based on ongoing negotiations could create uncertainty for businesses planning production and imports in affected sectors."
