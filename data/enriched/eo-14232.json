    "summary": "This executive order modifies tariffs imposed on certain goods from Mexico to reduce negative impacts on the U.S. automotive industry, including lowering some duties and exempting specific automotive parts traded under the USMCA agreement. It aims to maintain supply chain stability and minimize disruption for American workers and businesses connected to automotive manufacturing while continuing efforts to address illicit drug flow at the southern border.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Reduced tariffs could limit the effectiveness of sanctions aimed at curbing illicit activities at the southern border.",
      "The exemption of automotive parts might enable loopholes that undermine broader trade restrictions or enforcement efforts.",
      "Supply chain benefits could disproportionately favor large automotive companies over smaller domestic manufacturers.",
      "Implementation complexity could delay tariff adjustments and create uncertainty for importers and customs officials."
