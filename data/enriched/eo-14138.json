      "Succession may be disrupted if multiple positions listed are filled by acting officials simultaneously, limiting the pool of eligible successors.",

      "Eligibility restrictions under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act may limit available acting Directors during unforeseen circumstances.",
      "Lack of clarity on implementation protocols might cause operational delays during leadership transitions.",
      "Revoking the previous succession order may create transitional ambiguity if proper communication is not ensured."
