    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to comply strictly with the Hyde Amendment by ending the use of federal taxpayer funds to support elective abortions. It revokes two previous executive orders that allowed federal funding or promotion of elective abortion, and requires the Office of Management and Budget to issue implementation guidance to enforce this policy.",
