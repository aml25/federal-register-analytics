      "Phasing out private detention facilities may lead to capacity challenges in federal prisons if alternative arrangements are not adequately planned.",

      "There may be legal or contractual disputes from private prison operators over non-renewal of contracts.",
      "Transitioning from private to federal facilities may face implementation delays that affect detainee welfare and system efficiency.",
      "Critics might argue that simply ending private contracts does not fully address systemic issues of mass incarceration or racial disparities in the justice system."
