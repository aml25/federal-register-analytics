      "Efforts to rapidly hire specialized data and IT personnel could face legal or administrative hurdles within existing federal workforce rules.",
      "The increased public release of COVID-19 related data could inadvertently contribute to misinformation if data is misinterpreted or lacks proper context.",
      "Ensuring equity indicators and data access for marginalized communities requires ongoing oversight to prevent neglect or bias in data collection and dissemination."
