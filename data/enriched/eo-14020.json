      "The broad scope of the Council's responsibilities may lead to coordination challenges and overlap with existing federal agencies and initiatives.",
      "Effectively addressing intersectional discrimination may require complex data collection and analysis, raising privacy and resource allocation concerns.",
      "Implementation may face resistance from agencies due to differing priorities or limited agency budgets to support the Council’s goals.",
      "Some stakeholders may view certain initiatives, especially related to gender identity or reproductive rights, as politically contentious.",
      "Measuring progress and impact on gender equity across diverse sectors could prove difficult without clear benchmarks and enforcement mechanisms."
