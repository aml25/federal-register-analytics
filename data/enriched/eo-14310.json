    "summary": "This executive order delays enforcement of the law restricting TikTok and similar foreign adversary controlled applications until September 17, 2025, preventing penalties and enforcement actions during this period. It directs the Department of Justice to refrain from enforcement actions related to prior conduct as well and to issue guidance and communications ensuring no liability for violators within the delay period.",

      "State governments or private parties might attempt to enforce the law, leading to possible legal conflicts with federal authority.",
      "The indefinite backward waiver of penalties for prior conduct may incentivize future noncompliance with similar statutes."
