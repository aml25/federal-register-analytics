    "summary": "This executive order imposes new tariffs on goods imported from Canada to address the flow of illicit drugs, especially fentanyl, crossing the U.S. northern border. It aims to pressure Canada to take stronger enforcement actions against drug trafficking and human smuggling linked to Canadian sources, with the possibility of increasing tariffs if cooperation is not sufficient.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The tariffs may increase costs for U.S. importers and consumers, potentially harming small businesses and international shippers reliant on Canadian goods.",
      "There is a risk of escalating trade tensions or retaliatory tariffs from Canada, worsening bilateral relations and economic impacts.",
      "Effectiveness depends heavily on Canadian cooperation, which may not materialize, limiting the impact on illicit drug trafficking.",
      "Tariffs could disrupt supply chains, including energy resources, despite a lower rate for those products, impacting industries dependent on Canadian imports.",
      "The order may complicate legal and administrative processes for certifying goods and enforcing new duties, burdening customs and importers."
