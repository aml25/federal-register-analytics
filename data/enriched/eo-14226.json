    "summary": "This executive order modifies a previous order that imposed duties to limit the flow of illicit drugs across the U.S. northern border by changing rules about duty-free treatment of certain imported goods. It sets conditions under which duty-free shipments will no longer be allowed once customs systems are ready to fully collect tariffs on these goods. The order aims to enhance enforcement of tariffs related to illicit drug control while clarifying implementation provisions.",

      "Small importers and international shippers may face increased costs and administrative burdens when duty-free de minimis treatment is withdrawn.",
      "Delays or inefficiencies in customs systems could complicate the timing and enforcement of ending duty-free treatment, causing uncertainty for businesses.",
      "Potential controversy over the balance between trade facilitation and strong enforcement on goods linked to illicit drug flows at the northern border.",
      "The order’s reliance on Secretary of Commerce notifications may create delays or political influence in tariff implementation decisions.",
      "Increased tariffs and enforcement might indirectly impact consumers through higher prices or reduced availability of certain cross-border goods."
