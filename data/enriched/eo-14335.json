      "Streamlining environmental reviews could lead to insufficient assessment of environmental impacts, harming local ecosystems near launch sites.",

      "The shift to faster approval processes may disadvantage smaller or newer entrants unable to navigate accelerated timelines as effectively as established companies.",
      "Interagency coordination challenges and conflicting priorities could delay implementation despite the intended streamlining.",
      "Possible tension between national security needs and commercial innovation could lead to ambiguous or conflicting regulatory requirements."
