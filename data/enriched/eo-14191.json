    "summary": "This executive order promotes educational choice by encouraging states to use federal funds and grants to support scholarship programs, private schools, and other non-traditional K-12 education options. It directs several federal departments to explore and implement ways to expand educational opportunities for families, including those who are low-income, military-connected, or eligible for Bureau of Indian Education schools.",

      "Expanding funding for private and faith-based schools may divert resources from traditional public schools, potentially exacerbating inequities.",
      "Increased emphasis on educational choice could lead to decreased oversight and variable educational quality among participating institutions.",
      "Use of federal block grants for non-public education might raise legal challenges related to separation of church and state.",
      "Implementation timelines of 60 to 90 days may be unrealistic for comprehensive planning and stakeholder consultation.",
      "Military and Native American education funding shifts may create coordination challenges across federal and state agencies."
