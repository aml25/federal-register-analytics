    "summary": "This executive order sets a specific order of succession for who can act as Attorney General if the top officials in the Department of Justice are unable to serve. It names certain U.S. Attorneys to fill in temporarily and clarifies that acting officials must meet legal eligibility requirements. The order also revokes a previous succession order and allows the President flexibility to depart from the set order when legally permitted.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The designated succession order might bypass other qualified officials leading to potential operational disruption or conflicts.",
      "Limiting acting capacity only to those fully eligible under the Vacancies Reform Act could create gaps if no eligible official is immediately available.",
      "Allowing presidential discretion to depart from the order may raise concerns about politicization or inconsistent application.",
      "The revocation of the prior executive order may cause transitional confusion until fully implemented."
