      "The extension and expanded duties for many advisory committees may increase administrative burdens and resource demands on federal agencies without additional funding.",
      "Frequent amendments and overlapping roles could create confusion or inefficiencies in interagency coordination and advisory committee management.",
      "Efforts to expand awareness and equity initiatives for AA and NHPI communities may face challenges in consistency, tracking progress, or integrating across diverse agencies.",
      "Some advisory committees have overlapping scope which may lead to duplicated efforts or unclear lines of responsibility.",
      "The absence of an abstract or detailed justification limits transparency on the direct benefits or cost implications of continuing so many advisory committees simultaneously."
