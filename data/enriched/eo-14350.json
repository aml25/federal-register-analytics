    "summary": "This executive order extends the delay on enforcing the law that restricts TikTok and other foreign adversary-controlled applications until December 16, 2025, meaning the Department of Justice will not take enforcement actions or penalties during this time or retroactively. It also directs the Attorney General to issue guidance and notifications clarifying that no violations occurred during the delay period and to prevent states or private parties from attempting enforcement, preserving federal exclusive authority.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Extending the enforcement delay could prolong potential national security risks from continued TikTok operations under foreign influence.",
      "The order may hinder efforts to hold companies accountable for noncompliance with the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, reducing regulatory effectiveness.",
      "Allowing the Department of Justice to forego enforcement retroactively could set a precedent that weakens future enforcement of cyber and foreign adversary-related legislation.",
      "The restriction on states and private parties enforcing the Act may cause tensions between federal and state authorities or private sector actors seeking remedies.",
      "Delays in enforcement may frustrate stakeholders who support immediate restrictions and harm perceived executive branch credibility on national security issues."
