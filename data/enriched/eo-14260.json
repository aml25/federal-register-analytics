    "summary": "This executive order directs the Attorney General to identify and challenge state and local laws that create barriers to developing and producing American energy, especially those related to climate change policies or that discriminate against out-of-state energy producers. It aims to protect and promote domestic energy production and interstate energy trade by limiting what states can do to regulate or penalize energy development beyond their legal authority.",
