    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to ensure that men are not allowed to compete in women’s sports at educational institutions receiving federal funding, emphasizing fairness, safety, and privacy for female athletes. It calls for rescinding funding from programs that permit male participation in women’s sports, coordinating with states and international bodies to promote sex-based sports categories, and restricting entry to the U.S. for males seeking to compete in women’s sports.",
