    "summary": "This executive order creates a council to review the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) effectiveness and impartiality in disaster response, especially following recent major disasters. The council will evaluate FEMA’s structure, operations, and coordination with state and local governments, and provide recommendations to improve its disaster relief capabilities.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The accused political bias within FEMA and the focus on immigration enforcement may politicize disaster response and undermine trust in FEMA’s impartiality.",
      "The council's recommendations may lead to significant structural changes that could disrupt ongoing disaster relief efforts or reduce FEMA’s ability to respond rapidly.",
      "Overemphasis on limiting FEMA’s role to support functions might weaken federal disaster response capacity during large-scale emergencies requiring direct federal intervention.",
      "Soliciting public comments and diverse stakeholder input may slow down the council’s work, delaying important reforms.",
      "FEMA’s resources and priorities may shift away from non-immigration disaster missions, potentially neglecting some vulnerable populations affected by disasters."
