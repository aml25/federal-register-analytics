    "potential_concerns": [
      "Removing certain regulations could unintentionally weaken protections that prevent anti-competitive behavior, potentially harming smaller businesses in the long term.",
      "The review and modification process may be slowed by inter-agency coordination, delaying intended economic benefits.",
      "Public input mechanisms might be limited in influence, reducing transparency and community engagement in regulatory changes.",
      "The focus on deregulation might prioritize economic effects over other public interests such as consumer protection, environmental standards, or labor rights.",
      "Some agencies might resist or inadequately justify retaining anti-competitive regulations, reducing the overall effectiveness of the order."
