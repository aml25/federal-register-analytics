    "summary": "This executive order temporarily pauses new investigations and enforcement actions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for 180 days while the Department of Justice reviews and updates enforcement guidelines. The goal is to reduce what the order describes as excessive enforcement that harms American businesses’ ability to compete globally and impacts U.S. foreign policy and national security interests.",

      "Pausing FCPA enforcement risks allowing corruption and unethical business practices to go unchecked internationally.",
      "Reduced enforcement may damage the United States' global anti-corruption leadership and diplomatic standing.",
      "American companies might face reputational harm or legal risks abroad if corruption controls are weakened.",
      "The temporary suspension could lead to uncertainty and inconsistent application of the law during the review period.",
      "Critics may argue that the order prioritizes economic interests over ethics and rule of law."
