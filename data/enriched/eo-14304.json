    "summary": "This executive order directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to update and remove outdated regulations that currently prohibit supersonic flight over land, aiming to enable safe, quieter, and more efficient supersonic air travel in the United States. It also coordinates federal research efforts and promotes international cooperation to set noise and safety standards for civil supersonic aircraft.",

      "Foreign countries might disagree with U.S. standards, complicating international regulatory alignment and operations.",
      "Technological and safety challenges in certifying new supersonic aircraft could slow implementation or risk accidents.",
      "Industry competition may disadvantage companies that lacked early access to research funding or regulatory input."
