    "summary": "This executive order pauses all new U.S. foreign aid for 90 days to review if these programs align with the President’s foreign policy and American interests. It requires agency heads to evaluate aid programs’ effectiveness and consistency with policy, with the possibility to continue, modify, or end them based on this review.",

      "The 90-day pause may disrupt critical development projects and harm partner countries reliant on U.S. aid.",
      "Determinations on program continuation could be heavily influenced by political considerations over objective effectiveness.",
      "Limited transparency and possible waiver authority concentrated in the Secretary of State’s discretion could reduce accountability.",
      "Cutting or modifying aid programs abruptly may damage U.S. diplomatic relationships and global reputation.",
      "Smaller NGOs or international organizations may be disproportionately impacted by funding delays or cancellations."
