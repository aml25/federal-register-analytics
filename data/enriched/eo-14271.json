    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to prioritize purchasing commercially available products and services when possible, to save taxpayer money and incorporate private sector innovations into government procurement. It requires agencies to review and justify any purchases of custom, non-commercial solutions and report on their compliance with these rules.",

      "Strict emphasis on commercial products may limit flexibility for agencies requiring highly specialized or unique solutions.",
      "Smaller or specialized contractors that develop custom solutions may face decreased federal contracting opportunities.",
      "The administrative burden of reviewing and justifying non-commercial procurements could delay urgent or critical acquisitions.",
      "Over-reliance on commercial products may increase cybersecurity risks if not carefully vetted for government use.",
      "Implementation may face resistance from agencies accustomed to existing contracting practices and exceptions."
