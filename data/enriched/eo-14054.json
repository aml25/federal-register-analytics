    "potential_concerns": [
      "Premature termination of the emergency could reduce U.S. leverage if political reforms in Burundi do not continue or regress.",
      "Lifting restrictions may allow individuals previously sanctioned for contributing to violence or repression more freedom, raising human rights concerns.",
      "Reduced sanctions and entry suspensions could be seen as weakening U.S. commitment to regional stability and democracy promotion.",
      "Implementation may require careful coordination to ensure that ongoing legal actions or investigations linked to the prior emergency remain unaffected."
