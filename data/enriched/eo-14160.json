    "summary": "This executive order limits birthright citizenship in the United States by excluding certain children born on U.S. soil if their mothers are unlawfully present or temporarily present and the fathers are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents at the time of birth. It directs federal agencies to ensure they do not issue or recognize citizenship documents for these individuals born after 30 days from the order date.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The order may effectively repeal or undermine the constitutional interpretation of birthright citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment, leading to legal challenges.",
      "Children affected by the order may face statelessness or barriers to access government services, education, and legal protections.",
      "Implementation could create complex verification and enforcement challenges and inconsistent application across federal agencies.",
      "The order may disproportionately impact immigrant families, raising concerns about discrimination and family separation.",
      "The definition of 'mother' and 'father' could create administrative complications and controversy regarding parental rights and citizenship eligibility."
