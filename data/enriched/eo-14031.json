      "Some stakeholders may question the sustainability and funding availability given the Commission’s stated two-year term and reliance on existing appropriations.",
      "Potential overlaps or redundancies with prior initiatives and advisory bodies could complicate interagency collaboration.",
      "There may be debate over how to balance addressing disparities while avoiding unintended reinforcement of stereotypes or community divisions."
