    "summary": "This executive order directs federal authorities to end the cashless bail system in the District of Columbia and to hold dangerous criminal suspects in custody before trial to protect public safety. It also requires the Attorney General to review and push for changes in local policies that allow suspects to be released without bail, particularly for violent and serious offenses. Federal agencies may use available means, including funding decisions, to encourage the District government to modify these policies.",

      "The order may lead to increased pretrial detention, disproportionately impacting economically disadvantaged individuals who cannot afford bail.",
      "There may be legal challenges regarding federal intervention in District of Columbia local criminal justice policies.",
      "Pushing federal funding leverage could strain federal-local government relations and complicate cooperation on public safety.",
      "The lack of an explicit focus on due process rights could raise civil liberties concerns.",
      "Implementation may overwhelm federal detention facilities and courts handling additional pretrial detainees."
