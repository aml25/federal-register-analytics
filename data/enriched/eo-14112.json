      "Prioritizing Tribal set-asides or funding flexibility may reduce resources or competitiveness for non-Tribal entities currently receiving similar federal funds.",
      "Identifying and addressing chronic underfunding could require significant budget increases, creating challenges for federal budgetary priorities and stakeholders.",
      "Ensuring consistent and meaningful Tribal consultation across numerous agencies may be difficult and risk uneven implementation or Tribal dissatisfaction."
