    "summary": "This executive order cancels a series of prior executive orders, memoranda, and presidential determinations primarily issued under the Biden administration. It aims to rescind actions seen as harmful to federal governance and policy, restoring what the order calls 'common sense' to the federal government. The revoked items cover topics such as public health, national security, labor standards, energy, and biotechnology.",
