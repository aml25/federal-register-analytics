    "summary": "This executive order implements a trade agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom that reduces tariffs and non-tariff barriers for UK automotive, aerospace, steel, aluminum, and pharmaceutical products. It establishes tariff-rate quotas and streamlines trade rules to enhance American access to UK markets while addressing U.S. national security concerns linked to supply chains and imported goods.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The reduced tariffs and quotas might increase competition for some U.S. manufacturers not covered by specific protections, potentially leading to job losses.",
      "Delays or disagreements in meeting UK supply chain security standards could stall beneficial tariff-rate quotas for steel and aluminum, limiting economic gains.",
      "The order’s reliance on future determinations by the Secretary of Commerce may cause uncertainty for businesses awaiting clarity on tariff quotas for steel and aluminum.",
      "There may be political or public backlash against easing tariffs on certain UK imports perceived as threats to domestic industries or national security.",
      "Enforcement and monitoring of supply chain security and origin requirements could prove complex and resource-intensive for federal agencies."
