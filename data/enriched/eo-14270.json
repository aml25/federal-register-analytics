    "summary": "This order requires certain federal agencies regulating energy production to include expiration dates on their regulations, forcing periodic review and removal of outdated rules. The goal is to reduce regulatory burdens, promote innovation, and modernize the U.S. energy sector by rescinding costly and outdated regulations.",

      "Removing or expiring regulations may weaken environmental protections and lead to increased ecological harm.",
      "Frequent regulation expirations could create uncertainty for energy companies and investors planning long-term projects.",
      "Agencies might lack sufficient resources or capacity to conduct thorough reexaminations within short timelines.",
      "The policy may disproportionately favor fossil fuel and traditional energy producers over renewable energy sectors.",
      "Public participation could be limited if sunset extensions and regulatory reviews occur without robust comment opportunities."
