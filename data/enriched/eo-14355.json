      "Increased federal focus and funding on pediatric cancer AI initiatives might divert resources from other medical research areas.",
      "Private sector entities without adequate expertise might struggle to effectively utilize complex multimodal data, limiting translation into clinical benefits.",
      "Implementation challenges across diverse federal and state health systems could slow adoption and integration of AI technologies."
