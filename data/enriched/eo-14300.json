    "summary": "This executive order directs a major reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to accelerate the approval and deployment of new nuclear reactors by streamlining NRC’s operations, revising regulations, and adopting science-based safety standards. It aims to boost U.S. nuclear energy capacity, support innovative reactor technologies, and enhance American energy independence and national security.",

      "Strict deadlines and fee caps on the NRC could pressure rushed approvals, potentially compromising thorough safety evaluations.",
      "Workforce reductions at the NRC could cause loss of institutional knowledge and reduce regulatory capacity.",
      "Emphasizing rapid nuclear power expansion may lead to less attention on environmental impacts and alternatives like renewable energy sources."
