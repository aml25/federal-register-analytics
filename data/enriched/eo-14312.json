    "summary": "This executive order removes various U.S. sanctions on Syria following positive developments by the new Syrian government, while maintaining targeted restrictions on terrorist groups and human rights violators. It authorizes U.S. officials to relax export controls, encourages accountability for the former Syrian regime, and directs engagement with international partners to support peace and stability in Syria.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Removing broad sanctions may inadvertently ease economic or political pressure on actors still engaged in harmful activities despite new government changes.",
      "Implementation may be challenged by verifying compliance and distinguishing legitimate Syrian government entities from terrorist-linked or human rights-violating actors.",
      "There could be heightened risks if sanctions relief benefits actors associated with narcotics trafficking or chemical weapon proliferation inadvertently.",
      "Suspension of sanctions risks criticism from human rights advocates concerned about accountability for past abuses under the former regime.",
      "The order’s complexity may cause administrative delays or legal challenges in coordinating revocations, waivers, and ongoing counterterrorism designations."
