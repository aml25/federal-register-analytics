    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to take action against the threats posed by unauthorized drones to public safety, critical infrastructure, and national security. It establishes a task force to coordinate efforts, improve drone detection and tracking, enforce airspace regulations, and enhance counter-drone capabilities especially for major events like the FIFA World Cup 2026 and the 2028 Summer Olympics.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Increased surveillance and drone detection measures may raise privacy concerns, particularly regarding the collection of personal identifying information tied to drone operators.",
      "Stricter enforcement and expanded criminal penalties could disproportionately impact hobbyist drone users or small operators who inadvertently violate rules.",
      "Implementation complexity may arise from coordinating multiple federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial agencies with varying legal authorities and capabilities.",
      "Technical and regulatory challenges could delay the establishment of effective geofencing and drone flight restrictions, limiting timely protection of sensitive sites.",
      "Reliance on evolving technology and legal frameworks risks gaps in airspace security if laws and regulations fail to keep pace with emerging unmanned aircraft system threats."
