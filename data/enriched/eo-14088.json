    "summary": "This executive order expands restrictions on economic activities with Nicaragua, including banning certain imports, exports, and investments, to respond to ongoing political and human rights concerns. It also extends sanctions to individuals and entities connected to these activities and authorizes U.S. officials to enforce and report on these measures. The order aims to increase pressure on the Nicaraguan government regarding its treatment of journalists and dissenters.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The expanded sanctions could worsen economic hardship for ordinary Nicaraguans, potentially harming civilians more than the targeted regime.",
      "Implementation may be difficult due to challenges in monitoring and enforcing restrictions on foreign investment and exports linked to Nicaragua.",
      "The order’s broad language around sanctioning media outlets might raise concerns about unintended impacts on legitimate journalistic activities or freedom of the press.",
      "Trade and investment restrictions might strain diplomatic relations and limit options for engagement with Nicaragua in resolving broader regional issues.",
      "Businesses and U.S. persons operating in sectors newly targeted might face compliance complexities and economic losses."
