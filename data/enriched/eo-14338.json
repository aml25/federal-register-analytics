      "The initiative may face challenges recruiting and retaining top design talent within federal pay and bureaucratic constraints.",
      "Focusing on aesthetics and design upgrades could divert resources from other critical government IT modernization needs.",
      "Standardizing design across agencies might limit customization needed to address unique agency mission requirements.",
      "The temporary nature of the National Design Studio may lead to loss of momentum or discontinuity after three years.",
      "Ensuring compliance with existing laws like the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act could complicate implementation timelines."
