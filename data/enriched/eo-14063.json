    "potential_concerns": [
      "Requiring project labor agreements may reduce the pool of potential contractors, limiting competition and possibly increasing project costs.",
      "The $35 million threshold and other criteria for large-scale projects might exclude some complex smaller projects that could benefit from labor agreements.",
      "Implementation delays could occur while agencies develop regulations and training, creating uncertainty during the transition period.",
      "Agencies may inconsistently apply exceptions, leading to disputes or perceptions of favoritism in contract awards.",
      "Small businesses could face challenges navigating collective bargaining requirements despite stated protections."
