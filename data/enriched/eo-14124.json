    "summary": "This executive order establishes a White House Initiative to support Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) by increasing their access to federal resources, improving educational equity and economic opportunities for Hispanic and Latino students, and creating a presidential advisory board to guide federal policies benefitting these institutions. The initiative aims to strengthen HSIs’ capacity to serve their communities and ensure students can succeed academically and economically.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The focus on HSIs may lead to funding and resource shifts that unintentionally reduce support for non-HSI institutions, creating competition or resentment.",
      "Coordination across multiple federal agencies could complicate implementation and delay impact due to bureaucratic challenges.",
      "Without sustained and increased appropriations, the Initiative’s goals may be difficult to achieve, limiting meaningful improvements for HSIs.",
      "Establishing advisory boards and new administrative structures may increase federal administrative costs without clear accountability or measurable outcomes.",
      "Efforts to align HSI programs with national economic needs might pressure institutions to prioritize workforce demands over broader educational goals."
