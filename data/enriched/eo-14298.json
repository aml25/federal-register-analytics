    "summary": "This executive order temporarily reduces certain additional tariffs on goods imported from the People's Republic of China in order to support ongoing trade discussions and improve economic relations. It suspends higher tariff rates previously imposed and sets a uniform 10 percent additional duty for 90 days while maintaining some related duty adjustments to ensure overall trade policy goals are met.",

      "Reduced tariffs may adversely impact U.S. manufacturers who face increased competition from imports.",
      "Temporary tariff suspension could lead to uncertainty for businesses relying on consistent trade policies.",
      "There may be criticism that lowering tariffs rewards unfair trade practices or shows weakness in enforcing trade rules.",
      "Implementation requires coordination across multiple agencies, which could delay effective enforcement or cause inconsistent application.",
      "The 90-day suspension period may be too short to realize meaningful progress in bilateral trade negotiations."
