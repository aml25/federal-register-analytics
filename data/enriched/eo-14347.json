    "summary": "This executive order authorizes the continued use of the historic name \"Department of War\" as a secondary title for the existing Department of Defense and its officials, emphasizing a focus on military strength and readiness to wage war if necessary. It directs the Secretary of Defense (also called the Secretary of War) to submit notifications and recommendations toward permanently renaming the Department of Defense to the Department of War, while preserving current statutory and legal frameworks.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The use of the term \"Department of War\" may be viewed as unnecessarily aggressive and could raise diplomatic tensions or alarm international partners.",
      "Maintaining statutory references to the Department of Defense while using the secondary title \"Department of War\" could cause confusion in legal, administrative, and international contexts.",
      "Implementing dual naming might complicate interagency communications and legal interpretations during wartime or defense-related decision-making.",
      "The order's emphasis on military readiness to \"fight and win wars\" rather than just defense could shift policy priorities and provoke debate over the U.S. defense posture.",
      "Potential resistance from within the Department and from Congress regarding the renaming and related legislative actions could delay or obstruct implementation."
