    "summary": "This executive order directs the Office of the Federal Register and related agencies to reduce delays and cut costs in publishing federal regulations by modernizing systems and streamlining processes. It also requires reports on publication times and fee schedules to ensure fees reflect actual costs and improvements made. The goal is to support deregulation efforts and save taxpayer money by making the publication process more efficient.",
