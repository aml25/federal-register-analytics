    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to strictly enforce U.S. immigration laws by increasing removals, detentions, and prosecutions of unauthorized aliens, while revoking prior administration policies that eased immigration enforcement. It establishes federal-state task forces to combat human smuggling, strengthens penalties for illegal presence, and encourages voluntary compliance and expedited removal of unlawful immigrants.",

      "The order's broad enforcement priorities risk targeting diverse immigrant populations, including those with temporary legal status or protections.",
      "Operation of Homeland Security Task Forces nationwide may increase militarization of immigration enforcement and impact local communities."
