    "summary": "This executive order strengthens the use of probationary and trial periods for new federal employees by requiring agencies to actively certify that an employee should be retained before their appointment becomes permanent. It repeals existing regulations that made it harder to terminate underperforming probationary employees and establishes new rules to ensure agencies better evaluate employee fitness during these initial periods.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The new requirement for agency certification could lead to inconsistent application or subjective criteria, potentially harming employee morale.",
      "Probationary employees might face increased job insecurity and stress due to heightened risk of termination without typical appeal protections.",
      "Managers may be reluctant to certify employees despite satisfactory performance to avoid risks, potentially leading to workforce instability.",
      "Implementation deadlines and administrative requirements could strain agency resources and delay effective application of the new rules.",
      "Repeal of protections under prior regulations might reduce due process for probationary employees and generate legal challenges."
