    "summary": "This executive order excludes certain federal agencies and subdivisions involved in intelligence, counterintelligence, investigation, and national security work from federal labor-management relations programs. It updates and expands exclusions to include units related to hydropower operations, specific parts of the Department of Commerce, NASA, and the U.S. Agency for Global Media to protect national security interests.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Excluding certain agencies from labor-management relations protections could weaken collective bargaining rights for affected federal employees.",
      "The broadened exclusions may reduce transparency and oversight in critical government functions related to national security.",
      "There may be operational challenges in determining which subdivisions qualify for the exclusion, potentially causing confusion or inconsistent application.",
      "Unions and employee advocates might argue the order disproportionately limits labor rights for workers in sensitive but non-combat roles.",
      "The order could set a precedent for further exemptions that might erode established labor protections in other federal agencies."
