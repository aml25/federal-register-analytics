    "summary": "This executive order bans federal funding and support for medical treatments, including hormone therapies and surgeries, intended to change the sex of individuals under 19. It directs federal agencies to cease coverage and research related to these treatments, excludes them from military and employee health insurance, and prioritizes enforcement actions against practices and entities supporting such medical interventions for minors.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The order may limit access to medically recommended care for transgender and gender non-conforming minors, potentially worsening mental and physical health outcomes.",
      "Legal challenges could arise over civil rights, parental rights, and medical privacy protections due to the sweeping bans and enforcement actions.",
      "Federal agencies and healthcare providers may face difficulties implementing uniform policies due to conflicting state laws and medical standards.",
      "Excluding coverage from federal insurance programs like TRICARE and FEHB may impose financial burdens on affected families and minors.",
      "The order’s negative language about gender-affirming care and associated groups risks increased stigma and discrimination against transgender youth."
