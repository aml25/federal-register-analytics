      "The tariff increases could raise costs for U.S. consumers and small businesses relying on low-value imports from China.",
      "Retaliatory trade measures may escalate into a broader trade conflict, harming diplomatic and economic relations.",
      "Implementation may pose administrative challenges for customs and postal agencies handling increased duties on low-value shipments.",
      "Higher tariffs could incentivize importers to reroute or misdeclare goods to avoid increased duties, complicating enforcement.",
      "The order might disproportionately impact small importers and international shippers who rely on duty-free or low-duty shipments."
