    "summary": "This executive order directs the federal government to revitalize the U.S. nuclear energy industry by strengthening the domestic nuclear fuel cycle, expanding uranium production and reactor construction, supporting workforce development, and securing supply chains. It aims to ensure national security, energy independence, and future economic competitiveness through increased investment, regulatory support, and coordination across agencies.",

      "Increased government involvement and funding may disadvantage renewable energy sectors competing for federal support.",
      "Dependence on voluntary agreements with industry could limit oversight and lead to inequitable resource allocation favoring certain firms.",
      "Ramping up uranium mining and processing may cause local environmental and community impacts that are inadequately addressed.",
      "Workforce development efforts might fall short if educational and industry partnerships fail to meet demand or if funding is insufficient."
