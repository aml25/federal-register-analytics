    "summary": "This executive order suspends the duty-free de minimis exemption for all imports entering the United States, meaning all shipments regardless of value must now pay tariffs and duties. The goal is to prevent evasion of tariffs and reduce the flow of illicit drugs by ensuring duties are fully collected on low-value shipments from all countries. Special duty rates and procedures are established for shipments sent through the international postal network until further rules are finalized.",

      "Suspending duty-free de minimis treatment could increase costs and delays for consumers and small businesses relying on low-value imports.",
      "The new duty collection methods for international postal shipments may be complex and burdensome for carriers and customs agencies to implement.",
      "Higher duties might incentivize smuggling or evasion through other means, potentially undermining enforcement goals.",
      "Foreign trading partners could view these measures as trade barriers, potentially escalating trade tensions.",
      "Administrative challenges in coordinating multiple agencies and updating systems could delay effective enforcement."
