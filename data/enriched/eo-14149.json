    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to stop censoring speech protected by the First Amendment and prohibits the government from pressuring social media and other platforms to suppress certain viewpoints. It also requires an investigation into government actions over the past four years that may have infringed on free speech rights and calls for corrective measures based on those findings.",

      "Limiting government engagement with content moderation may hinder efforts to combat harmful misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation online.",
      "The order's broad prohibition on government pressure could reduce coordination with private platforms to address illegal or dangerous speech.",
      "Investigations of past government actions could lead to political conflicts, selective enforcement, or perceptions of retaliation.",
      "Ambiguity in defining what constitutes unconstitutional censorship may lead to uneven or inconsistent application across agencies.",
      "Potential chilling effects on government communication strategies that rely on partnerships with social media to promote public safety and health information."
