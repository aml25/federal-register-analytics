    "summary": "This executive order ends the federal government’s COVID-19 vaccination requirements for federal employees and contractors, reversing earlier mandates issued during the pandemic. It recognizes that COVID-19 is no longer in an acute emergency phase and allows agencies to rescind related safety policies while emphasizing continued voluntary vaccination.",

      "Removing vaccination requirements may increase COVID-19 exposure risk among federal employees and contractors, especially vulnerable individuals.",
      "The order may lead agencies to prematurely rescind other COVID-19 safety protocols, potentially undermining workplace safety.",
      "Displaced federal workers who resisted vaccination mandates might face stigmatization or difficulties reintegrating into federal roles.",
      "There could be uneven implementation across agencies causing confusion about vaccine and safety policies.",
      "Public perception of rolling back vaccination requirements may reduce voluntary vaccination uptake among the general population."
