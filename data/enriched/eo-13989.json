    "summary": "This executive order requires all new political appointees in the executive branch to sign an ethics pledge that limits their ability to accept gifts from lobbyists, restricts certain post-government employment activities, and promotes decision-making based solely on the public interest. It establishes rules for enforcing these commitments and ensures transparency and accountability to reduce corruption and restore public trust in government.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The ethics pledge’s restrictions on post-government employment may limit qualified candidates from accepting government appointments due to future career concerns.",
      "Enforcement mechanisms may face challenges related to proving violations and ensuring consistent application across agencies.",
      "The broad authority granted for waivers could potentially be used to undermine the restrictions, reducing the order’s effectiveness.",
      "Political appointees might be incentivized to find loopholes or informal ways to circumvent these ethics commitments.",
      "The order does not apply to non-political career employees, potentially leaving gaps in ethics oversight."
