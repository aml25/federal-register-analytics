    "summary": "This executive order directs the Secretary of Commerce to investigate whether imports of timber, lumber, and related wood products threaten U.S. national security due to unfair foreign trade practices and supply chain vulnerabilities. It emphasizes strengthening domestic production capacity and security of the wood products industry critical to both civilian construction and military needs, with possible trade action recommendations to protect this sector.",

      "Trade restrictions or tariffs imposed following the investigation could increase costs for U.S. consumers and industries relying on imported wood products.",
      "Efforts to prioritize domestic production may face challenges meeting demand or could lead to supply shortages in the short term.",
      "Foreign exporters negatively affected might retaliate with their own trade barriers, escalating trade tensions.",
      "Investments in expanding domestic capacity could take time, delaying the intended national security benefits.",
      "Determining the balance between fair trade enforcement and free market competition may lead to legal and diplomatic disputes."
