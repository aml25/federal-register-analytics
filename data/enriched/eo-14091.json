    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to strengthen efforts to promote racial equity and support underserved communities by embedding equity into their policies, programs, procurement, and decision-making processes. It establishes agency equity teams and a White House Steering Committee to coordinate these efforts, and requires agencies to engage with impacted communities and submit annual equity action plans. The order aims to create more equitable economic opportunities, improve civil rights enforcement, advance equitable data practices, and ensure equitable procurement and development policies, especially benefiting those historically denied access or opportunities.",
