      "Implementing emergency temporary standards quickly may face legal challenges or pushback from businesses and states.",
      "Increased enforcement activities could strain OSHA resources and require significant funding that may not be immediately available.",
      "Efforts to enforce mask-wearing and COVID-19 protections may cause conflicts between employers and workers or among political groups.",
      "Coordination with state occupational safety agencies could be uneven, leading to inconsistent worker protections across states.",
      "Outreach efforts may struggle to effectively reach all vulnerable populations, particularly workers in informal or less-accessible sectors."
