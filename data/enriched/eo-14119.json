      "Expanding apprenticeship requirements in federal grants and contracts may increase compliance burdens and costs for contractors and grantees, potentially disadvantaging small businesses and non-union employers.",
      "Focusing hiring and career advancement on Registered Apprenticeships might disadvantage workers who do not participate in such programs or who come from non-traditional backgrounds.",
      "Implementation depends on agency coordination and sufficient appropriations, so resource constraints or uneven adoption could limit effectiveness.",
      "Reestablishing Labor-Management Forums may create tensions in agencies where labor-management relations are contentious or where unions have limited presence.",
      "The order’s emphasis on apprenticeship and apprenticeship-aligned hiring might inadvertently reduce flexibility in agency hiring practices or slow recruitment in urgent positions."
