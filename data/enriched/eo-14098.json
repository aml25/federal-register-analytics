    "summary": "This executive order imposes U.S. sanctions on individuals and entities undermining peace, democracy, and stability in Sudan, including those responsible for violence, corruption, and human rights abuses. It also restricts their access to U.S. financial resources and entry into the United States, while supporting a democratic transition in Sudan through coordinated international assistance once a civilian transitional government is established.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Sanctions may inadvertently harm innocent civilian populations by restricting humanitarian aid and economic activity.",
      "Identifying and accurately targeting responsible individuals and entities may be challenging, risking wrongful designation or exclusion of key actors.",
      "Coordination with international partners might face delays or disagreements that could reduce the effectiveness of the sanctions and support efforts.",
      "Restrictions on travel and transactions might hinder diplomatic engagement and conflict resolution efforts.",
      "The order's broad criteria for designation could lead to uncertainty and increased compliance burdens on financial institutions and U.S. persons."
