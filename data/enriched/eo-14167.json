It requires the Secretary of Defense to revise defense plans and issue new directives to strengthen the military's role in protecting the United States’ territorial integrity, especially along the southern border.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Increased military involvement in border security could blur lines between civilian law enforcement and military roles, raising legal and civil liberty concerns.",
      "Prioritizing the military to repel unlawful mass migration and drug trafficking risks potential human rights issues and could negatively impact undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers.",
      "The order’s broad language about repelling 'forms of invasion' may enable expansive use of force without clear limits or oversight.",
      "Implementation depends on appropriations, which could delay or limit enforcement effectiveness and create uncertainty about resource allocation.",
      "Intensified border security efforts might strain relations with neighboring countries and complicate diplomatic or foreign policy efforts related to migration and regional security."
