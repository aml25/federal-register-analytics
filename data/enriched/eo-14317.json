    "summary": "This executive order creates a new category called Schedule G for certain federal government jobs that have a policy-making or policy-advocating role and are expected to change with a new President. It fills a gap in existing hiring categories by formally establishing how these positions are identified and appointed, particularly in the Department of Veterans Affairs, while emphasizing non-partisan selection based on suitability for the President's policies.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The new Schedule G could blur lines between political appointments and career civil service, risking politicization of certain federal roles.",
      "Lack of explicit veteran preference in Schedule G positions may reduce opportunities for veterans compared to other excepted service schedules.",
      "Implementation challenges may arise in defining which positions truly qualify as policy-making or policy-advocating, leading to inconsistency across agencies.",
      "By exempting removals from civil service regulations, there is potential for arbitrary or unfair dismissals of Schedule G employees.",
      "Focusing initial appointments in the Department of Veterans Affairs could raise concerns about politicizing a veteran-focused agency."
