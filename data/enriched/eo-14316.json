    "summary": "This executive order extends a temporary suspension of certain additional tariffs imposed on U.S. trading partners in response to trade imbalances, continuing reduced duties through August 1, 2025. It maintains separate tariff treatment for China while directing federal agencies to take necessary actions to implement the extension of these tariff adjustments.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Extending tariff suspensions may reduce leverage to address unfair trade practices, potentially weakening U.S. trade negotiating positions.",
      "Certain U.S. industries could face continued competition from imports due to lowered tariff protections, possibly harming domestic manufacturers.",
      "Differential tariff treatments might cause trade tensions or disputes with excluded nations such as China.",
      "Implementation complexity across multiple federal agencies may lead to delays or inconsistent enforcement.",
      "The executive order’s reliance on classified or undisclosed information may limit transparency and public understanding of policy rationale."
