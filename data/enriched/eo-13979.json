      "The order could slow down the rulemaking process by adding extra layers of approval and oversight.",
      "Limiting rulemaking authority to senior appointees might reduce career officials' expertise and flexibility in policy development.",
      "There may be legal challenges regarding the extent to which agencies can reassign or restrict delegation of rulemaking authority under existing statutes.",
      "The order could politicize agency rulemaking, undermining nonpartisan expert decision-making.",
      "Smaller or understaffed agencies might struggle to comply due to resource constraints for conducting extensive reviews and reporting."
