    "summary": "This executive order creates the Gold Card visa program, which allows immigrants to obtain expedited visas by making a substantial financial gift to the U.S. Department of Commerce. The program aims to prioritize immigrants who are successful entrepreneurs or investors and align immigration policy with U.S. economic and national interests.",

      "The program may favor wealthy individuals and corporations, potentially exacerbating inequalities in immigration opportunities.",
      "There is a risk that expedited processing could bypass comprehensive security and background checks, raising national security concerns.",
      "Reliance on financial gifts as visa criteria could be criticized as commodifying immigration and undermining merit-based or humanitarian considerations.",
      "Implementation may be challenged by the need to carefully balance expedited processing with legal limits on visa numbers and public safety safeguards.",
      "The program could divert resources from addressing illegal immigration and other broader immigration enforcement priorities."
