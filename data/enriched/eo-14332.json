    "summary": "This order directs federal agencies to strengthen oversight and coordination of discretionary federal grants to ensure they align with agency priorities and the national interest, avoid wasteful or controversial funding, and improve accountability. It requires agency leaders to designate senior officials to review grant opportunities and awards, limit funding for administrative costs, and include clear benchmarks for success, while also revising grant terms to allow termination if priorities are not met.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The order’s ideological criteria for grant approval may politicize scientific research and limit academic freedom or support for diversity initiatives.",
      "Strict oversight and termination clauses could disrupt ongoing important research projects if interpretations of agency priorities shift.",
      "Smaller or less established research institutions might be disadvantaged due to preferences for institutions with lower indirect costs or proven administration of 'Gold Standard Science.'",
      "The requirement for senior appointees to independently override expert peer review may undermine merit-based grant evaluations and reduce scientific rigor.",
      "Implementation complexity across multiple agencies could delay grant funding and create administrative burdens without clear measures for efficiency gains."
