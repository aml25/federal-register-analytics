    "summary": "This executive order modifies existing tariffs on certain Brazilian imports by removing some agricultural products from an additional 40 percent duty. It reflects progress in ongoing negotiations with the Brazilian government and aims to adjust trade measures originally imposed due to perceived threats to U.S. national security and economy.",

      "Removing tariffs on certain Brazilian agricultural products could harm U.S. farmers and agricultural workers facing increased competition.",
      "Ongoing negotiations may lack transparency, causing uncertainty for businesses on both sides.",
      "The national security justification for the original tariffs might be questioned or diluted by this modification.",
      "Implementation and enforcement challenges could arise in properly categorizing which products are exempt from the additional duties.",
      "Tariff changes might provoke retaliatory measures from other trade partners or impact broader U.S. trade policy consistency."
