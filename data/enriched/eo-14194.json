    "summary": "This executive order imposes a 25% tariff on all products imported from Mexico to pressure the Mexican government to better control illegal migration and drug trafficking across the southern U.S. border. It expands a national emergency declaration related to border security and authorizes federal agencies to enforce and report on these measures until Mexico takes sufficient action to address these issues.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The tariffs may increase costs for American consumers and businesses relying on Mexican imports, potentially leading to inflation or supply chain disruptions.",
      "Retaliatory tariffs or trade barriers from Mexico could harm U.S. exporters and escalate into a broader trade conflict.",
      "The order could exacerbate tensions with Mexico and hinder bilateral cooperation on immigration and drug enforcement.",
      "Increased tariffs may disproportionately impact small importers and low-margin businesses unable to absorb higher costs.",
      "The effectiveness of tariffs in compelling Mexico to take specific enforcement actions is uncertain and may not resolve the immigration and drug trafficking challenges."
