    "summary": "This executive order blocks the assets of Afghanistan’s central bank held in U.S. financial institutions to prevent their transfer or use, aiming to protect those funds for the benefit of the Afghan people amid the country's worsening humanitarian crisis. It declares a national emergency to address risks posed by economic collapse and restricts access to these assets while allowing certain official government transactions.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Blocking Afghanistan’s central bank assets may limit the Afghan government’s ability to stabilize its economy and deliver essential services.",
      "Legal challenges from claimants asserting rights to these assets could complicate enforcement and prolong asset freezes.",
      "The order may inadvertently harm ordinary Afghan citizens by restricting access to funds needed for humanitarian aid and economic recovery.",
      "Implementation depends heavily on coordination among multiple U.S. agencies and financial institutions, which could cause delays or inconsistent application.",
      "Without clear criteria for unblocking or use of funds, there may be disputes over how assets are eventually allocated or disbursed."
