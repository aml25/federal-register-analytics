Its goal is to attract both domestic and foreign investors by making it easier to invest in and build businesses that support economic growth.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The focus on facilitating investments above $1 billion may exclude small and medium investors, potentially limiting broader economic benefits.",
      "Reducing regulatory burdens may risk weakening environmental, labor, or community protections during large development projects.",
      "Coordinating across federal, state, and local governments could face bureaucratic delays or conflicts despite intent to streamline.",
      "There may be national security risks if expedited processes fail to adequately vet foreign investments despite stated safeguards.",
      "The creation of a specialized office may lead to duplication or overlap with existing federal economic development or investment programs."
