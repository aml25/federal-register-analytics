    "summary": "This executive order aims to improve the foster care system by modernizing data and technology, expanding educational and employment support for children and youth in or transitioning out of foster care, and strengthening partnerships with faith-based organizations. It focuses on making foster care more effective, increasing opportunities for foster youth, and ensuring qualified caregivers are not excluded due to religious beliefs.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Using religious beliefs as a basis to exclude certain qualified foster or adoptive parents may lead to discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals or other groups, potentially harming children needing placement.",
      "Integrating artificial intelligence and predictive analytics in foster care decisions could raise privacy, bias, and fairness concerns impacting vulnerable children and families.",
      "Reallocating returned federal funds by states could reduce resources in other child welfare areas if not managed carefully.",
      "Implementing new data collection and modernization efforts within 180 days may be challenging for under-resourced state agencies and lead to inconsistent outcomes.",
      "Increasing faith-based organization involvement might blur the lines between government and religious activities, raising constitutional or diversity concerns."
