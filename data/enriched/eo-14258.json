    "potential_concerns": [
      "Extending the enforcement delay may prolong national security risks associated with foreign adversary controlled apps such as TikTok.",
      "The order could create uncertainty and disrupt regulatory clarity for tech companies and other affected private-sector entities.",
      "Allowing states or private parties to be barred from enforcement could limit multi-level government responses to threats.",
      "There may be challenges in balancing national security with protecting companies' operational and compliance rights during the extension period.",
      "Critics may argue that delaying enforcement undermines the legislative intent of protecting Americans from foreign adversaries."
