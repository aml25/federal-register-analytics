      "Broad discretion delegated to department heads could lead to inconsistent or politicized application of exclusions.",
      "Lack of clear criteria for what constitutes national security work might cause confusion or disputes over applicability.",
      "The order may strain labor relations within affected agencies, impacting morale and retention.",
      "Limited transparency and oversight of exclusions could raise concerns about accountability."
