    "summary": "This executive order directs the federal government to stop using racial disparity data as a basis for school discipline policies, promoting instead 'commonsense' discipline focused strictly on student behavior and safety. It requires new guidance to prevent what the order describes as 'discriminatory equity ideology' in school discipline and mandates reports and revised policies to ensure discipline is fair, safe, and free from race-based considerations.",

      "Removing consideration of racial disparities in discipline may lead to increased racial discrimination and unequal treatment of minority students.",
      "Ignoring systemic factors contributing to disparities might worsen school safety and student outcomes for marginalized groups.",
      "The order's restriction on 'equity ideology' could undermine efforts to address implicit bias and promote inclusivity in schools.",
      "Implementation may create conflicts between federal nondiscrimination law enforcement and local school discipline practices.",
      "Mandated reports and policies could politicize school discipline and shift focus away from evidence-based behavioral interventions."
