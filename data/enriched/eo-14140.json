    "summary": "This executive order expands and updates sanctions related to destabilizing actions in the Western Balkans by blocking property and restricting transactions with individuals and entities involved in undermining peace, security, democratic institutions, or engaging in corruption in the region. It builds on previous orders to further target those responsible for threats to regional stability and human rights abuses, strengthening U.S. tools to support peace and security in the Western Balkans.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The expanded sanctions could complicate diplomatic efforts by further alienating key actors or governments in the Western Balkans.",
      "Broad language in designations may risk unintended consequences affecting innocent individuals or entities with tenuous connections to targeted parties.",
      "Enforcement challenges may arise due to the complexity of tracking property and transactions across multiple jurisdictions and ownership structures.",
      "The order could increase tensions with countries or actors who view U.S. sanctions as overreach or politically motivated interference.",
      "There may be legal or procedural challenges in determining who qualifies under various criteria, potentially leading to disputes or delays in implementation."
