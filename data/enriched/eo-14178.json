      "The outright prohibition on Central Bank Digital Currencies may hinder future monetary innovation and limit the Federal Reserve's policy options.",
      "Regulatory uncertainty could persist during the transition as previously issued frameworks and policies are revoked and revised.",
      "Prohibiting CBDCs despite global trends could place the U.S. at a disadvantage in international financial markets and digital currency development.",
      "The order restricts regulatory agencies’ discretion, potentially limiting effective oversight and consumer protections in the evolving digital asset space.",
      "Privacy and security concerns may arise if protections against emerging digital financial threats are insufficiently addressed."
