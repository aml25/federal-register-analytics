      "Increased law enforcement presence and aggressive crime-fighting tactics may lead to over-policing and civil rights concerns, especially in marginalized communities.",
      "The prompt removal of homeless encampments on federal lands could displace homeless individuals without providing adequate alternative housing or support services.",
      "Stronger immigration enforcement efforts could create fear and uncertainty among undocumented immigrants and immigrant communities in the D.C. area.",
      "Coordination among multiple federal and local agencies may face bureaucratic challenges, potentially limiting the effectiveness of the task force.",
      "Efforts to strictly enforce laws on protests and demonstrations might restrict lawful free speech and political expression in public spaces."
