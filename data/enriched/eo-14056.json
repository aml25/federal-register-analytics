      "Balancing national security concerns with commercial and civil space interests might lead to conflicts or policy gridlock.",
      "Reliance on existing appropriations and legal constraints could slow down the Council’s effectiveness and responsiveness to emerging space challenges.",
      "The lack of an explicit public or congressional oversight mechanism for the Council’s work might raise accountability concerns."
