    "summary": "This executive order bans federal funding for dangerous gain-of-function biological research conducted abroad in countries without adequate oversight, such as China, and strengthens safety and oversight measures for federally funded life-science research in the U.S. It requires stricter accountability, transparent reporting, and periodic review of research policies to reduce risks to public health, national security, and the economy, while maintaining U.S. global leadership in biotechnology.",

      "The restriction on funding foreign research, especially in countries like China, could hinder international scientific collaboration and innovation.",
      "Increased enforcement and reporting requirements may impose administrative burdens and slow down urgent scientific research.",
      "Defining and policing 'dangerous gain-of-function research' could lead to disputes or inconsistencies in implementation across agencies.",
      "Limiting gain-of-function research might reduce preparedness or delay breakthroughs needed to understand and respond to biological threats.",
      "The policy’s focus on stricter controls without corresponding federal funding increases for safer research environments could disadvantage some researchers and institutions."
