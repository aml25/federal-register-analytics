    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to ensure American patients pay no more for prescription drugs than the lowest prices available in other developed countries. It tasks agencies with negotiating drug prices, enabling direct-to-consumer sales at these prices, and taking enforcement actions against unfair foreign and domestic pharmaceutical pricing practices. The goal is to end price discrimination that causes Americans to subsidize global pharmaceutical costs.",
