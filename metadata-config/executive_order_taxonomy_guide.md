# Executive Order Taxonomy: Impacted Populations & Themes

This dictionary provides standardized tags for classifying executive orders by **who they affect** and **what topics they address**. Based on analysis of ~300+ executive orders across multiple administrations (Bush 2001-2008, Obama 2016, Trump 2017 & 2025, Biden 2021).

## How to Use This Taxonomy

### For LLM-Generated Tagging

When using an LLM to automatically tag executive orders, you can:

1. **Provide the full taxonomy** as context, then ask the model to select relevant tags
2. **Ask for confidence scores** (high/medium/low) for each tag
3. **Distinguish primary vs. secondary** impacts (directly targeted vs. indirectly affected)
4. **Include impact polarity** (positive, negative, neutral)

### Example Prompt Pattern

```
Given the following executive order text, identify:

1. PRIMARY impacted populations (directly targeted or affected)
2. SECONDARY impacted populations (indirectly affected)
3. PRIMARY themes (main policy areas)
4. SECONDARY themes (related topics)
5. Impact type for each population (positive/negative/neutral)

Use only tags from the provided taxonomy.

## Impact Classification

For each population, classify the impact as:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Positive** | The EO is intended to benefit this group or expands their rights/protections |
| **Negative** | The EO restricts, reduces benefits, or creates burdens for this group |
| **Neutral** | The EO affects this group procedurally without clear positive/negative impact |

### Important Notes on Impact Classification

- **Perspective matters**: What one group views as positive, another may view as negative. Document the objective effects rather than political interpretation.
- **Primary source**: Base impact classification on the actual text and stated intent of the EO
- **Be specific**: "Undocumented immigrants - Negative (increased enforcement)" is more useful than just "Negative"
- **When in doubt, use Neutral**: If the impact is genuinely procedural or administrative without clear benefit or harm, classify as Neutral

## Suggested Additions During Enrichment

The following tags were suggested by the LLM during enrichment but not found in the taxonomy. Review these for potential inclusion.

### EO 14360: importers-exporters
- **Type:** population
- **Suggested Category:** Special Populations (negative impact)
- **EO Title:** Modifying the Scope of the Reciprocal Tariffs With Respect to Certain Agricultural Products
- **Justification:** This order directly affects entities involved in importing/exporting affected agricultural products, who are not explicitly captured in existing taxonomy categories.
- **Date Suggested:** 2025-12-12

### EO 14357: opioid-crisis-patients
- **Type:** population
- **Suggested Category:** Health-Related Populations (negative impact)
- **EO Title:** Modifying Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People's Republic of China
- **Justification:** This executive order directly targets the supply of synthetic opioids, which directly impacts individuals struggling with opioid addiction and those affected by overdose, a population not specifically covered under the existing taxonomy.
- **Date Suggested:** 2025-12-12

### EO 13703: people-who-inject-drugs
- **Type:** population
- **Suggested Category:** Demographic Groups (negative impact)
- **EO Title:** Implementing the National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States for 2015-2020
- **Justification:** This group is specifically named in the order as experiencing disparities and at heightened HIV risk but is not included in the existing taxonomy and thus should be added for direct impact consideration.
- **Date Suggested:** 2025-12-12

### EO 13703: southern-u-s-residents
- **Type:** population
- **Suggested Category:** Geographic Communities - Regional (negative impact)
- **EO Title:** Implementing the National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States for 2015-2020
- **Justification:** The order specifically cites people living in the Southern United States as a priority population with elevated HIV burden, but no exact regional group for 'southern U.S. residents' exists in the current taxonomy.
- **Date Suggested:** 2025-12-12

### EO 14058: Digital Government / Customer Experience
- **Type:** theme
- **Suggested Category:** Government Operations
- **EO Title:** Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery To Rebuild Trust in Government
- **Justification:** The order focuses extensively on improving federal customer experience and service delivery through human-centered digital design and modernization, which is broader than but related to government IT modernization. Because this specific focus on customer experience and digital service delivery is not directly captured by existing taxonomy terms, a dedicated theme for Digital Government / Customer Experience would better cover the scope of this executive order.
- **Date Suggested:** 2025-12-12

### EO 14114: foreign-financial-institutions
- **Type:** population
- **Suggested Category:** Organizational Entities (negative impact)
- **EO Title:** Taking Additional Steps With Respect to the Russian Federation's Harmful Activities
- **Justification:** The EO targets foreign financial institutions directly by sanctioning them, but the taxonomy lacks a dedicated category for these entities.
- **Date Suggested:** 2025-12-12

### EO 14112: Native American / Tribal Affairs
- **Type:** theme
- **Suggested Category:** Civil Rights & Equity
- **EO Title:** Reforming Federal Funding and Support for Tribal Nations To Better Embrace Our Trust Responsibilities and Promote the Next Era of Tribal Self-Determination
- **Justification:** The order specifically focuses on Tribal Nations, their sovereignty, and federal funding/support tailored to them, which is not explicitly covered by current themes. A dedicated theme is needed to categorize policies related to Native American and Tribal governments and their unique status.
- **Date Suggested:** 2025-12-12

### EO 14356: national-security-personnel
- **Type:** population
- **Suggested Category:** Employment Sectors > Government (negative impact)
- **EO Title:** Ensuring Continued Accountability in Federal Hiring
- **Justification:** The EO explicitly prioritizes hiring and staffing related to national security, but no exact taxonomy population currently captures 'national security personnel'; this group is directly impacted both as an exception and as a prioritized segment.
- **Date Suggested:** 2025-12-12
