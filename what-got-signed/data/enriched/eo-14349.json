    "potential_concerns": [
      "The 120-day freeze on changing working conditions could prolong existing labor tensions and limit union members' ability to improve their conditions promptly, impacting transportation workers' morale and livelihoods.",
      "Emergency Board investigations might delay resolution, potentially disrupting Long Island Rail Road service affecting transportation workers and the commuting public relying on this infrastructure.",
      "If the Board’s recommendations favor the railroad company disproportionately, union members might perceive the order as undermining their bargaining power and worker-rights protections.",
      "The order’s limited timeframe for reporting may pressure the Board to produce rushed or incomplete findings, possibly leading to suboptimal outcomes for the involved labor organizations and transportation workers."
