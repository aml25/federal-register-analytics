    "potential_concerns": [
      "Increased private-sector involvement may prioritize programs aligned with business interests over broader educational goals, potentially limiting academic freedom for HBCU students and communities.",
      "The focus on workforce development in specific industries like technology and healthcare might marginalize students interested in liberal arts or other fields, affecting diversity of academic offerings at HBCUs.",
      "The requirement for State matching funds for 1890 Land-Grant Institutions could create funding disparities that indirectly affect some HBCUs relying on similar support, impacting students from rural or underserved African American communities.",
      "Annual progress reports and advisory boards may increase administrative burdens on HBCU leadership, potentially diverting attention from direct student support to compliance activities.",
      "Emphasis on public-private partnerships might lead to unequal access among smaller or less well-known HBCUs, exacerbating inequality within the HBCU network and the African American student population."
