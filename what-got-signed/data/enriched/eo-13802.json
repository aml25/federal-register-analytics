    "potential_concerns": [
      "Removing visa and foreign visitor processing goals may lead to slower or less predictable visa adjudication, negatively affecting visa-holders and foreign nationals who rely on timely entry to the U.S.",
      "Reduced performance metrics could decrease transparency and accountability within the Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs, potentially undermining interagency coordination efforts.",
      "Changes to visa processing priorities might inadvertently create processing backlogs that disproportionately affect students, tourists, and work visa applicants.",
      "Without clear goals, Homeland Security and State Department agencies may face challenges in synchronizing their approaches, leading to inconsistent policy enforcement impacting foreign visitors."
