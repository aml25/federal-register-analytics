    "summary": "This executive order sets a clear order of succession for who will lead the Department of Transportation if the Secretary and other senior officials are unable to perform their duties. It lists specific officials in the department who will take over in a predefined order until the Secretary or other eligible officials can resume their roles. The order also clarifies exceptions and presidential discretion around this succession process.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The predefined order of succession could lead to interim leadership that lacks the full perspective or authority to address complex transportation infrastructure issues, potentially impacting transportation-workers relying on stable management.",
      "Overreliance on a narrow set of officials for succession may slow decision-making during crises, adversely affecting government-efficiency and delaying responses critical to transportation infrastructure safety and operations.",
      "The exclusion of acting officials from succession eligibility might create leadership gaps or uncertainty during transitions, which could disrupt continuity in transportation policy and negatively impact transportation-workers.",
      "Presidential discretion to override the succession order may result in politicized appointments that do not prioritize operational expertise, possibly undermining trust among transportation-workers and stakeholders."
