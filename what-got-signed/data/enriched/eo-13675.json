    "potential_concerns": [
      "Efforts to expand U.S.-Africa trade and investment might disproportionately benefit larger corporations over small businesses and entrepreneurs, limiting inclusive economic growth.",
      "The Advisory Council's private-sector appointment process might overlook diverse representation, including minority-owned businesses such as those from African American communities, thus narrowing the scope of advice and opportunities.",
      "Focusing on infrastructure and agriculture sectors in Africa could unintentionally sideline U.S. working-age adults employed in industries not prioritized by the Council, affecting job creation projections.",
      "Without sustained funding beyond the Council’s two-year term, potential gains in trade partnerships and job creation for U.S. small businesses and startups could stall, reducing long-term impact."
