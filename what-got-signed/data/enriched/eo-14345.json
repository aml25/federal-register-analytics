    "summary": "This executive order implements a new trade agreement between the United States and Japan that adjusts tariffs on Japanese imports to promote fair trade and protect U.S. national security. It establishes a baseline tariff structure, provides Japan with expanded access to U.S. markets, and authorizes significant Japanese investment in the United States to support American jobs and manufacturing.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The imposition of a baseline 15 percent tariff on most Japanese imports may lead to increased prices for consumers, negatively impacting household budgets and consumer choice.",
      "While expanded Japanese investment is intended to create American jobs, there is a risk that foreign investment could lead to control over critical U.S. manufacturing and defense assets, raising national security concerns particularly for defense-industry-workers.",
      "Agricultural-workers and farmers may face uncertainties depending on how Japan implements increased agricultural purchases, potentially causing market volatility or trade disputes if commitments are not fully realized.",
      "Automotive-industry-workers could be affected by tariff adjustments on vehicles and parts, which may shift supply chain dynamics and employment patterns in the sector.",
      "Investors may encounter regulatory uncertainties and complexities related to the interplay of trade measures and national security provisions, especially under Foreign Investment regulations like CFIUS."
