    "summary": "This order directs the Department of Labor and the Securities and Exchange Commission to make it easier for 401(k) and other defined-contribution retirement plans to include investments in alternative assets like private equity, real estate, and digital assets. It aims to reduce regulatory burdens and litigation risks that currently limit such investment opportunities, helping more Americans diversify their retirement savings and potentially achieve better long-term returns.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Increased access to alternative assets may expose retirement savers to higher risks and less liquidity, potentially jeopardizing their savings.",
      "Expanding alternative investments could lead to costly and complex fiduciary responsibilities that smaller plan managers may find difficult to manage prudently.",
      "Efforts to reduce litigation risks for fiduciaries may limit participants' ability to challenge poor investment decisions or conflicts of interest.",
      "Revisions to SEC accredited investor and qualified purchaser definitions could reduce investor protections or increase exposure to nontraditional and less regulated investments.",
      "Implementation depends heavily on regulatory agencies’ actions within 180 days, potentially causing uncertainty or delays affecting retirement plan investment options."
