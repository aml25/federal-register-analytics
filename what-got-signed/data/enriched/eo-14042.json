    "summary": "This executive order requires federal contractors and their subcontractors to follow COVID-19 safety protocols approved by the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force, ensuring a safer work environment to reduce the spread of COVID-19. It applies to most new and renewed contracts for services and related activities with the federal government, aiming to improve worker safety and government procurement efficiency.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The order's mandated COVID-19 safety protocols may increase operational costs and administrative burdens on federal contractors, particularly impacting non-union workers who may have less bargaining power regarding workplace safety conditions.",
      "Federal contractors could face workforce disruptions due to compliance requirements, such as vaccine mandates or testing protocols, potentially leading to labor shortages or absenteeism among working-age adults employed by these contractors.",
      "Implementation inconsistencies across subcontractors and lower-tier contractors may create confusion and uneven enforcement of safety protocols, undermining the intended benefits for workers and affecting overall government procurement efficiency.",
      "The exclusion of small contracts under the simplified acquisition threshold might leave some working-age workers without enhanced protections, possibly creating pockets of higher COVID-19 risk within the broader federal contracting workforce."
