    "summary": "This executive order directs the United States to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO), reversing a previous retraction of withdrawal. It pauses funding and involvement with the WHO, ends U.S. participation in related global health agreements, and sets internal actions to safeguard public health and biosecurity independently from the WHO.",

      "Withdrawing from the WHO may impair pandemic preparedness and response coordination, negatively impacting healthcare workers and patients due to reduced access to timely global health information and resources.",
      "The disruption of U.S. funding to the WHO risks undermining international health initiatives, harming global health populations reliant on WHO programs for disease control and vaccination.",
      "Ending participation in WHO-related global health agreements may isolate the U.S. from cooperative biosecurity efforts, increasing vulnerabilities in managing cross-border health threats.",
      "Reassigning U.S. personnel from the WHO could diminish America's influence in shaping global health policy, weakening diplomatic ties with international organizations and partners."
