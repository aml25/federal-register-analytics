    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to prioritize buying commercially available products and services whenever possible, rather than custom-developed government-unique solutions. It requires agencies to review ongoing contracts to ensure they follow these policies and to justify any exceptions, aiming to reduce unnecessary government spending and encourage cost-effective purchasing.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The emphasis on commercially available solutions may disadvantage specialized federal contractors who develop custom government-unique systems, reducing their contract opportunities and revenue.",
      "Small business owners might face challenges competing with large commercial vendors if agencies prioritize readily available commercial products, potentially limiting government contracting diversity.",
      "The requirement for rigorous market research and justification of exceptions could delay procurement timelines and increase administrative burden, impacting timely project execution.",
      "Mandating commercial solutions might limit innovation for highly specialized government needs that cannot be fully met by off-the-shelf products, potentially affecting mission-critical capabilities."
