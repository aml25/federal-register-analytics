      "Employees in federal agencies required to work on December 24, 2020, due to national security or essential needs may experience reduced holiday time, affecting work-life balance and morale, especially among military personnel who remain on active duty.",
      "The exemption allowing certain agency heads to keep operations open for defense or public need might create inconsistency and perceptions of unfair treatment among federal employees excused from work on this day.",
      "Operational continuity for military personnel and essential federal workers may be strained if understaffing occurs due to excused absences of other federal employees, potentially impacting military readiness and defense effectiveness.",
      "Federal employee pay and leave accounting adjustments for this holiday closure may lead to confusion or administrative errors, affecting workforce satisfaction and government efficiency."
