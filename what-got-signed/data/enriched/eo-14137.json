    "summary": "This executive order establishes the official order of succession for who will take over as Secretary of the Treasury if both the Secretary and Deputy Secretary are unable to perform their duties. It lists specific Treasury officials by rank who are authorized to act as Secretary during such vacancies, while allowing the President discretion to deviate from the order as allowed by law. The order also revokes a prior similar order from 2016.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Ambiguity in the discretion allowed to the President to deviate from the established order could lead to disputes or uncertainty during leadership transitions.",
      "Officials serving in acting capacities are excluded from succession, which may limit available leadership options in some scenarios.",
      "Changes in succession order may create uncertainty or political challenges within the Department of the Treasury during transitions.",
      "Lack of explicit guidance on communication and coordination during succession could impact operational continuity.",
      "Revocation of the previous order might cause transitional confusion if not properly communicated and implemented within the Department."
