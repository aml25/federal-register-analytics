    "potential_concerns": [
      "The rigid order of succession may limit the President's flexibility in appointing the most qualified acting Secretary during emergencies, potentially affecting political-appointees' authority and Department leadership stability.",
      "Excluding officials serving in acting capacities from the succession order could create leadership gaps or delays if multiple vacancies occur simultaneously, impacting department continuity.",
      "The revocation of the previous 2016 order might generate confusion or transition issues among political-appointees familiar with the prior succession rules.",
      "This order may unintentionally empower lower-level political appointees with acting Secretary duties without explicit vetting, raising concerns about accountability and continuity."
