    "potential_concerns": [
      "Greater reliance on faith-based communities in addiction recovery could lead to unequal access or exclusion of non-religious individuals or those from minority faiths, impacting the inclusivity of treatment options.",
      "Interagency coordination challenges may delay or complicate service delivery, particularly affecting individuals experiencing poverty and homeless individuals who require timely, integrated support.",
      "The initiative’s focus on scientific and evidence-based treatment may face resistance in some communities or settings where stigma around addiction or mental health conditions persists, limiting uptake among these populations.",
      "Veterans with substance use disorders might encounter gaps if programs do not adequately address co-occurring mental health conditions or fail to integrate with existing VA services effectively."
