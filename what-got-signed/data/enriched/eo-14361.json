    "summary": "This executive order modifies the previous tariffs imposed on certain products from the Government of Brazil by exempting some agricultural products from the additional 40 percent duty. The changes reflect progress in ongoing negotiations with Brazil and are intended to address concerns related to national security, foreign policy, and economic threats posed by Brazil's policies.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The tariff exemptions on certain Brazilian agricultural products may benefit agricultural workers and small business owners who rely on these imports but could harm U.S. manufacturing workers and large corporations competing with Brazilian imports under the initial tariff scheme.",
      "Modifying tariffs during an ongoing national emergency declared under trade and national security grounds may undermine the enforcement strength of trade-policy agreements and complicate diplomatic relations if perceived as inconsistent by U.S. stakeholders.",
      "Reducing tariffs on Brazilian agricultural goods could increase dependency on foreign agricultural imports, potentially affecting the economic stability of rural communities and domestic farmers reliant on tariff protections.",
      "The adjustment of tariffs might lead to unintended economic shifts in sectors outside agriculture, such as manufacturing, thereby negatively impacting employment and wages in those industries."
