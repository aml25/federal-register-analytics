    "summary": "This executive order directs the federal government to change how civil immigration laws are enforced, prioritizing national security, humanitarian concerns, public health, and due process while revoking a previous order that emphasized interior immigration enforcement. It requires agencies to review and update policies to align with a more balanced and values-driven approach to immigration enforcement.",
