    "potential_concerns": [
      "The significant increase in tariffs on low-value imports from China may raise costs for retail workers and consumers who rely on affordable goods, potentially reducing consumer purchasing power.",
      "Small business owners and import-export businesses that depend on lower-cost Chinese imports could face increased operational costs, undermining their competitiveness and profitability.",
      "Manufacturing workers in U.S. industries competing with Chinese imports may benefit from tariff protections, but supply chain disruptions and price increases of imported inputs could negatively affect their employment stability.",
      "The escalation of reciprocal tariffs risks exacerbating trade tensions with China, possibly leading to further retaliatory measures that could harm U.S. exporters and the broader economy.",
      "Imposing such high tariffs under a declared national emergency framework may encourage prolonged use of emergency economic powers, raising policy and legal concerns about the balance between trade policy and national security."
