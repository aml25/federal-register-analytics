    "potential_concerns": [
      "The amended order of succession could create uncertainty or competition among senior Department of Agriculture political appointees regarding potential acting Secretary roles, affecting internal department dynamics.",
      "If succession lines favor certain offices disproportionately, it may unintentionally marginalize other qualified leaders within the Department, limiting diversity in high-level leadership opportunities.",
      "Strict adherence to eligibility under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act may lead to temporary vacancies or leadership gaps if designated successors do not meet those legal requirements."
