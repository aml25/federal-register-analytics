    "summary": "This executive order directs the federal government to better coordinate programs that support economically distressed and left-behind communities, including Tribal areas and rural regions. It aims to improve access to funding and technical assistance, promote community engagement, and foster long-term economic development and disaster resilience in these areas by encouraging interagency collaboration.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Coordination across multiple federal agencies may lead to bureaucratic delays that reduce timely delivery of benefits to low-income families and tribal communities in distressed areas.",
      "Preferences for funding applications from covered communities might unintentionally exclude or disadvantage organizations in similar communities that do not meet narrowly defined criteria, limiting access for some rural areas.",
      "Efforts to increase workforce development and local labor negotiation capacity could provoke resistance from private investors or large corporations, potentially slowing economic development in affected regions.",
      "Post-disaster economic resilience programs may not adequately address unique local needs in all tribal or rural communities, leading to uneven recovery outcomes and persistent disparities.",
      "Enhanced federal engagement might increase administrative burden on community-based organizations already operating with limited capacity, risking reduced effectiveness of local economic development initiatives."
