    "potential_concerns": [
      "The Buy American requirements and increased tariffs on PRC-origin components may raise costs for maritime industry suppliers and ultimately consumers, leading to higher prices for imported goods.",
      "Expanded shipbuilding and workforce development efforts might face challenges in quickly scaling training and credentialing maritime workers, potentially creating labor shortages or skills mismatches impacting working-age adults and union members.",
      "Increased federal investment focusing on large shipyards and corporations could marginalize small businesses and independent workers within the maritime supply chain, despite intentions to boost the industrial base.",
      "Trade restrictions targeting China may lead to retaliatory measures harming U.S. export-dependent industries and maritime international trade competitiveness.",
      "The order's emphasis on maritime and defense industrial base expansion risks uneven regional economic impacts, potentially benefiting coastal and maritime communities more than inland or rural areas."
