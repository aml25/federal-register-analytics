    "potential_concerns": [
      "Increased transportation demand and security measures may create burdens on urban communities and transportation workers, potentially causing delays and workforce strain before and during the events.",
      "Small business owners and hospitality workers in host cities may see economic benefits but also face challenges such as temporary labor shortages, price gouging, or increased operational pressures.",
      "Coordination across multiple federal agencies may lead to bureaucratic delays that could hinder timely infrastructure improvements critical to safety and transportation accessibility.",
      "Heightened homeland security focus may result in more intrusive screening or surveillance measures impacting residents and visitors, raising privacy and civil liberties concerns within urban communities.",
      "Economic growth from tourism may exacerbate existing inequalities if benefits are unevenly distributed, leaving some urban or low-income populations with increased costs of living but fewer advantages."
