    "potential_concerns": [
      "Implementation may face challenges in ensuring equitable funding and resource allocation to historically underfunded Black-serving institutions such as HBCUs and PBIs, potentially limiting the effectiveness of the initiative.",
      "Efforts to increase Black student enrollment and success in advanced placement and career-technical education programs may reveal or exacerbate gaps in access to qualified, culturally competent educators, impacting educational outcomes.",
      "Workforce development programs targeting Black working-age adults could unintentionally overlook subgroups such as LGBTQ+ individuals and DACA recipients, limiting the inclusivity and reach of economic opportunity initiatives.",
      "Coordinating federal interagency efforts risks bureaucratic delays and inconsistent execution, which may slow progress in closing educational and economic disparities for Black Americans.",
      "Expanding entrepreneurship and small business support for Black small-business owners may create competition for limited resources, possibly disadvantaging other underserved groups without careful balancing."
