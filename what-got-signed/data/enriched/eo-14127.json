    "summary": "This executive order directs multiple federal agencies to work together to combat new and emerging firearm threats, especially focusing on illegal devices that convert guns into machineguns and firearms made with 3D printing technology. It also requires the development and publication of research-based guidance to help schools improve active-shooter drills in ways that are effective and minimize trauma for students and educators.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Enhanced enforcement against 3D printed firearms and machinegun conversion devices may lead to tensions or legal challenges from gun owners and Second Amendment advocates who view these measures as restrictive or overreaching.",
      "The focus on disrupting digital designs and software used for 3D printing firearms could pose privacy or free speech concerns for technology workers involved in additive manufacturing or software development.",
      "Efforts to improve active-shooter drills, while aiming to reduce trauma for students including those with disabilities, risk inconsistent implementation across schools, potentially leading to unequal protection for vulnerable students and educators.",
      "Law enforcement officers at federal, state, and local levels may face increased operational demands and coordination challenges in identifying and seizing illicit 3D printed firearms and conversion devices, potentially straining resources.",
      "K-12 students and teachers could experience unintended psychological distress if active-shooter drill modifications are inadequately researched or poorly communicated despite the order’s intentions to minimize trauma."
