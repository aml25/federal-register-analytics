    "potential_concerns": [
      "Expanding PCAST membership to 32 may dilute the influence of existing scientific-researchers and technology-workers by increasing diversity but complicating consensus.",
      "Without clear criteria for member selection, the order could lead to underrepresentation of emerging scientific fields or minority technology disciplines.",
      "The increased council size may strain administrative resources and reduce meeting efficiency, indirectly limiting timely scientific advice impacting technology-workers.",
      "Lack of changes to agency authority may generate confusion among scientific-researchers on how PCAST recommendations align with agency actions."
