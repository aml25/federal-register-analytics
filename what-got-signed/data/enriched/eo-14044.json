    "summary": "This executive order updates a previous order to increase the maximum number of members allowed on the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) from a lower number to 32. It is meant to expand the council to provide broader scientific and technological advice to the President. The order also clarifies that it does not affect other agencies' legal authorities and depends on available funding.",

      "Expanding the number of council members could lead to coordination difficulties or inefficiencies in advising the President.",
      "Increasing membership might dilute the influence of individual experts or create challenges in reaching consensus.",
      "Without additional funding, the expanded council may face resource constraints limiting its effectiveness.",
      "Changes to advisory committees might raise concerns about politicization or shifts in the balance of expertise."
