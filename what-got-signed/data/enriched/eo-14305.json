    "summary": "This executive order directs the U.S. government to strengthen control and security over American airspace from threats posed by unauthorized or malicious drone activity. It establishes a federal task force, improves regulatory frameworks, enhances detection and enforcement capabilities, and promotes cooperation among agencies and local governments to protect critical infrastructure, military installations, and public events from drone-related risks.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The enhanced detection and enforcement capabilities may lead to increased surveillance and privacy infringements on consumers and visa holders, raising Fourth Amendment concerns.",
      "Undocumented immigrants and border community residents could face heightened enforcement actions and restrictions on drone use, potentially impacting humanitarian and cross-border activities.",
      "The increased restrictions on drone flights over critical infrastructure and public events may unintentionally limit commercial and recreational drone use, burdening consumers and businesses relying on drone technologies.",
      "Coordination among multiple law enforcement agencies to enforce new airspace regulations could cause jurisdictional conflicts and uneven application of rules in local communities.",
      "Military personnel and installations may benefit from better protection, but expanded counter-UAS operations could increase risks of misidentification or accidental engagement of lawful drone activities."
