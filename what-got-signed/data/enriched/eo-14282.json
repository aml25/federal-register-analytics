    "summary": "This executive order requires American universities to fully disclose all foreign funding they receive, including the true sources and purposes of the money. It directs the Department of Education to enforce these disclosure rules strictly, reverse previous weaker enforcement policies, and hold institutions accountable for noncompliance to protect national security and transparency in higher education.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Strict enforcement requiring full disclosure of foreign funding may cause American universities to reduce foreign collaborations, limiting research opportunities for college and graduate students.",
      "International students might face increased scrutiny or stigmatization due to concerns about foreign influence, potentially impacting their enrollment and academic experience.",
      "Universities may incur significant administrative burdens and costs to comply with detailed foreign funding disclosures, detracting resources from educational programs.",
      "Greater public transparency around foreign funds may inadvertently expose sensitive research areas, raising national security concerns despite intentions to improve transparency.",
      "The order's focus on foreign funding may disproportionately affect research partnerships with certain countries, possibly leading to racial or ethnic profiling concerns among international students and scholars."
