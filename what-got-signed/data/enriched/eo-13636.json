      "Privacy and civil liberties protections may be insufficiently enforced, leading to concerns among consumers about personal data use and surveillance during cybersecurity information exchanges (themes: data-privacy, homeland-security).",
      "The expansion of classified information sharing and security clearances for private sector personnel could create insider risk vulnerabilities if not properly managed, affecting cybersecurity-professionals directly involved in critical infrastructure defense (themes: homeland-security, interagency-coordination).",
      "Efforts to integrate sector-specific agencies and private sector interests could lead to regulatory complexity or conflicting requirements for corporations-businesses, increasing compliance burdens on large-corporation-employees (theme: interagency-coordination)."
