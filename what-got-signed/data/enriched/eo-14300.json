    "summary": "This executive order directs a major reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to speed up the licensing and deployment of new nuclear reactors in the United States. It aims to reduce regulatory delays and fees, update safety standards based on the latest science, and promote the U.S. as a global leader in nuclear energy while supporting energy security and job growth.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The expedited licensing and deregulation may compromise the safety protections for environmental justice communities near existing and new nuclear facilities, raising health and environmental risks.",
      "Rural communities hosting new or reactivated nuclear sites could face disproportionate exposure to radiation and environmental hazards due to relaxed radiation limits and streamlined oversight.",
      "Reducing the size and scope of the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards may weaken independent scientific review, potentially undermining public trust among workers and communities reliant on safe nuclear operations.",
      "The shift away from the linear no-threshold radiation model could lead to underestimating low-level radiation risks, affecting manufacturing and technology sector workers employed at nuclear plants or in related industries."
