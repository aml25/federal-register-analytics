      "Adjustments in pay rates may not fully reflect regional cost-of-living increases, potentially disadvantaging federal employees and military personnel stationed in high-cost areas despite locality pay schedules.",
      "The pay adjustments for senior executives and political appointees could widen pay disparities within the federal workforce, creating concerns about internal equity among civil servants and rank-and-file employees.",
      "Veterans employed within Veterans Health Administration could face complexities if pay adjustments are not aligned consistently across all VA pay schedules, potentially affecting retention and morale.",
      "Implementation of new salary schedules may have unintended administrative burdens and delays, causing temporary pay disruptions for federal employees, foreign service officers, and administrative law judges.",
      "The order supersedes a prior executive order within the same year, which may cause confusion or concern about the stability and predictability of federal pay policies among impacted populations."
