      "Restricting federal oversight on curriculum and instructional materials may limit protections for equitable education and reduce enforcement of civil rights standards for K-12 students, disproportionately affecting vulnerable student populations.",
      "State and local governments might struggle to maintain consistent educational quality without certain federal guidance, leading to increased disparities in educational outcomes across different regions.",
      "Teachers and educators may face confusion or conflicts arising from rescinded federal guidance, impacting their ability to deliver updated and evidence-based curriculum standards effectively.",
      "K-12 students could experience reduced access to diverse instructional materials or comprehensive educational content if federal regulations limiting control are rolled back, potentially affecting educational inclusiveness and rigor."
