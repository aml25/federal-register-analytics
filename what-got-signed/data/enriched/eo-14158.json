      "Technology workers may face increased pressure to rapidly adapt to new interagency coordination protocols and systems integration, potentially straining workforce capacity and morale.",
      "Interoperability mandates may unintentionally create vulnerabilities if legacy systems are integrated without thorough security vetting, risking sensitive government and citizen data."
