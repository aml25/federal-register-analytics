    "summary": "This executive order directs the Treasury Department to improve the process for identifying and helping people redeem matured U.S. savings bonds that have not yet been cashed in. It includes steps to digitize records, make ownership information available online, understand redemption barriers, and work with states to connect bond owners with their money.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The digitization and public accessibility of ownership records could raise privacy and data security concerns for seniors and other individuals who may have difficulty managing their personal information online, implicating records-classification-transparency themes.",
      "Low-income individuals and elderly populations might face barriers in accessing or navigating the Treasury Hunt tool, potentially limiting the order’s effectiveness in promoting financial literacy and equitable redemptions.",
      "Unintended exclusion or difficulty in identifying rightful owners of legacy paper savings bonds issued decades ago could reduce government efficiency and cause frustration among naturalized and birthright citizens attempting to redeem bonds.",
      "The collaboration with states to integrate data may lead to inconsistent implementation and potential delays, impacting U.S. citizens awaiting bond redemption and undermining the goal of government efficiency.",
      "There is a risk that focusing on digitization and online access might overlook populations less comfortable with technology, such as seniors-elderly, exacerbating financial disparities instead of promoting financial-literacy."
