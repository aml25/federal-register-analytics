      "Reducing regulatory burdens as part of regulatory-reform-deregulation may compromise environmental protections and food safety, potentially risking the health and economic stability of agricultural-workers-farmers and rural-communities.",
      "Efforts to preserve family farms and modify estate tax rules might disproportionately benefit established small-business-owners and landowners, possibly overlooking economically vulnerable farmers and workers in rural and tribal-communities-reservations.",
      "The emphasis on technological innovation and infrastructure improvements may widen the gap between wealthier agricultural-workers-farmers with access to capital and smaller or disadvantaged farmers lacking resources, exacerbating inequalities within rural-communities.",
      "Interagency coordination may lead to complex or conflicting policy recommendations, creating confusion or delays that negatively impact small-business-owners and agricultural-workers-farmers relying on timely regulatory clarity."
