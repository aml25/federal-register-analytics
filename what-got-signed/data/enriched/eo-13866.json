      "Adjustments to pay rates for federal employees and uniformed services may not keep pace with local cost-of-living increases, potentially affecting the retirement security and morale of working-age adults within these groups.",
      "Changes in locality-based comparability payments could unintentionally create pay disparities among federal employees in different regions, impacting workforce retention especially in high-cost urban communities.",
      "The order's superseding of prior pay schedules may lead to confusion or delays in implementation, temporarily affecting income stability for affected federal and military personnel.",
      "Veterans transitioning to federal civilian roles might face challenges if pay adjustments do not adequately recognize their prior service or specialized skills, affecting their financial security."
