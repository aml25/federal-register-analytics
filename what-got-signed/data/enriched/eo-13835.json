    "potential_concerns": [
      "The prohibition on transactions involving Venezuelan government debt directly impacts U.S.-based investors and financial-services workers by restricting investment opportunities and potentially causing financial losses.",
      "Employees of large corporations with significant operations or investments in Venezuela may face economic disruptions, including job insecurity, as their companies comply with the new financial restrictions.",
      "Citizens of Venezuela may experience exacerbated economic hardship and reduced access to international financial resources as a result of these sanctions, deepening the humanitarian crisis the order seeks to address.",
      "The sanctions could incentivize evasion tactics by Venezuelan entities or third parties, complicating enforcement and increasing risks of illicit financial activity."
