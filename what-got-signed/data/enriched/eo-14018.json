      "Removing regulatory relief provisions may increase administrative burden on federal agencies, indirectly impacting federal employees' workload and job conditions.",
      "Depending on how widely regulatory rollback is implemented, union members may experience reduced bargaining power or diminished labor-management cooperation.",
      "Unintended gaps in policy may emerge if revocations are rushed or incomplete, causing confusion or inconsistent application affecting federal employees and union members."
