    "summary": "This executive order directs the government to fill and maintain a national stockpile of key active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) that are critical to essential medicines. It aims to boost domestic production of these ingredients and ensure supply chain resilience by prioritizing U.S.-made APIs and creating a reliable reserve that can meet a six-month supply need.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Prioritizing domestically produced APIs may increase the cost of essential medicines, negatively impacting patients-general and healthcare-workers under cost constraints.",
      "Boosting domestic API manufacturing could strain manufacturing-workers with increased production demands before sufficient infrastructure or workforce training is established.",
      "A focus on a limited list of 26 critical drugs might leave supply vulnerabilities for other essential medicines, risking public-health-emergency-response efficacy for broader patient populations.",
      "If government procurement leads to market distortions, it may reduce competition among pharmaceutical suppliers, affecting healthcare-workers' medication options and pricing."
