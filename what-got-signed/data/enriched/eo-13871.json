    "summary": "This executive order imposes sanctions on individuals and entities involved in Iran's iron, steel, aluminum, and copper industries to cut off revenue that could support weapons programs, terrorism, and military expansion. It prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with those involved, restricts entry into the U.S. for such persons, and allows sanctions on foreign financial institutions facilitating these transactions.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Sanctions targeting Iran's iron, steel, aluminum, and copper sectors may severely disrupt corporations and foreign financial institutions engaged in legitimate trade, leading to economic losses for US and allied businesses.",
      "The travel restrictions and visa suspensions against involved persons could negatively impact visa holders who have legitimate reasons unrelated to sanctioned activities, potentially affecting Iranian students, workers, and tourists.",
      "The broad definition of persons 'operating in' or providing 'material support' to these sectors risks over-inclusion and unintended designation of entities indirectly linked to these industries, complicating international commerce.",
      "Foreign financial institutions may limit transactions overly broadly to avoid sanctions risks, which could restrict financial services for non-sanctioned individuals and businesses tied to Iran, harming international banking relationships.",
      "The order may escalate tensions with Iran, potentially leading to retaliatory measures affecting global supply chains and stability, disproportionately impacting corporations and foreign nationals connected to Iran."
