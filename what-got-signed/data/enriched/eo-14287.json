    "summary": "This executive order aims to identify and publicly list state and local jurisdictions that refuse to enforce federal immigration laws, commonly called 'sanctuary jurisdictions.' It directs federal agencies to withhold or limit funding to these jurisdictions, impose verification of eligibility for federal benefits in these areas, and ensure equal treatment of American citizens over illegal aliens in state and local policies.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Withholding federal funds from jurisdictions may harm residents who rely on public services regardless of local immigration policies.",
      "The designation of 'sanctuary jurisdictions' could deepen tensions and distrust between federal, state, and local governments.",
      "Increased federal enforcement and legal actions may lead to racial profiling or civil rights violations in affected communities.",
      "Efforts to verify eligibility for federal benefits in private entities could raise privacy concerns and administrative burdens.",
      "The order may discourage local officials from adopting policies that protect immigrant communities, potentially increasing public safety risks."
