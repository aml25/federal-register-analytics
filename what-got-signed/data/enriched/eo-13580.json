The group aims to ensure safe and efficient oil and natural gas development while protecting health, the environment, and indigenous communities. It also facilitates communication with state, local, and tribal governments related to energy projects.",

      "The expedited coordination and permitting process could lead to insufficient environmental review, potentially harming Alaska Natives and tribal communities who rely on natural resources.",
      "Increased oil and gas development may negatively impact the health and traditional lifestyles of Alaska residents, particularly indigenous populations.",
      "Energy-sector workers in oil and gas may face heightened workloads or safety risks due to accelerated development timelines mandated by improved interagency coordination.",
      "The focus on energy independence and resource development might prioritize economic goals over long-term environmental protection, raising concerns among Alaska residents and tribal governments about sustainable land and water use."
