It directs federal agencies to enforce these rules and encourages federal contractors to adopt similar policies to improve road safety and prevent distracted driving. The order also allows certain exemptions for law enforcement and national security purposes.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The prohibition on texting while driving government or personal vehicles for official business may be seen by federal employees as a restriction on their personal autonomy and work flexibility, potentially impacting morale under the theme federal-workforce-management.",
      "Ensuring consistent enforcement across diverse federal agencies could be challenging, leading to uneven implementation and possible disciplinary actions that might disproportionately affect some federal employees and contractors.",
      "Federal contractors might face increased compliance costs or operational disruptions if their workforce must adapt quickly to texting bans while driving, which could affect government procurement efficiency.",
      "Exemptions allowed for law enforcement and national security personnel could cause confusion or perceptions of unfairness among employees and contractors, impacting workplace safety culture.",
      "The order's encouragement of voluntary compliance while off duty may blur boundaries for federal employees, raising privacy and surveillance concerns regarding their behavior outside of official work hours."
