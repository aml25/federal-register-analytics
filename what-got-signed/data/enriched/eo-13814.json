    "potential_concerns": [
      "Expanded authority to activate reserve forces could lead to increased deployments and prolonged active duty for reservists and guardsmen, impacting their civilian employment and family lives.",
      "Rapid mobilization of military reservists may not adequately consider individual readiness or personal circumstances, potentially causing undue stress or hardship to service members.",
      "Heightened powers during national emergencies might increase the risk of politicization or overuse of military reserve activation, potentially undermining trust among military personnel and their communities.",
      "The order’s broad delegation of authority could lead to inconsistent application across service branches, causing confusion and disparate impacts on reservists.",
      "There may be insufficient safeguards or transparency measures to monitor and limit the use of these expanded activation powers, raising concerns for civil-military balance during counterterrorism efforts."
