      "The emphasis on accommodating religious beliefs in foster care placement may lead to exclusion or discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals or families wanting to foster children, impacting children-minors and caregivers-non-military.",
      "The use of AI and predictive analytics to improve caregiver recruitment and child matching risks unfair biases and privacy issues affecting children-minors and caregivers-non-military.",
      "Reallocating returned federal funds towards financial literacy and career programs might reduce direct support services for some low-income families, potentially disadvantaging children-minors and youth-young-adults currently in foster care.",
      "Increased involvement of faith-based communities may blur lines between church and state, potentially privileging religious organizations over secular support options, which could negatively impact children-minors and low-income-individuals-families relying on foster care services.",
      "The burden of modernizing outdated state-level data systems may result in uneven implementation across states, potentially delaying improvements for some children and youth currently in foster care."
