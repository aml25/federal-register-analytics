    "potential_concerns": [
      "The amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial may raise concerns among active-duty military personnel about changes to their legal rights and due process protections under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, potentially impacting morale and trust in military justice.",
      "Veterans could be indirectly affected if procedural changes lead to differences in adjudication outcomes or precedent-setting cases that later influence benefits or discharge characterizations.",
      "There is a risk that clarifying the non-retroactivity of the amendments may cause confusion or inconsistent application in ongoing cases for defendants-accused persons in military courts, possibly affecting perceptions of fairness.",
      "The order’s focus on military justice reform could unintentionally complicate the balance between maintaining military readiness and ensuring comprehensive criminal justice reform within the armed forces."
