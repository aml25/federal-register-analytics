It requires agencies to create equity teams, develop annual equity action plans, enhance engagement with underserved groups, promote equitable economic development in rural and urban areas, and improve equitable procurement and civil rights enforcement.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The expanded focus on equity and enhanced civil rights enforcement may lead to increased administrative complexity for agencies, potentially delaying access to benefits for underserved populations such as African Americans, Native Americans, and rural communities.",
      "Small disadvantaged businesses might face challenges meeting increased procurement goals, potentially excluding some due to capacity or bureaucratic hurdles despite intended federal support.",
      "Efforts to embed equity in AI and automated systems risk unintended algorithmic biases if not carefully monitored, potentially disadvantaging groups like individuals with disabilities and LGBTQ+ individuals.",
      "Heightened engagement requirements with underserved communities might strain agency resources, possibly limiting meaningful community involvement if proper funding and staff are not allocated.",
      "The emphasis on preventing displacement in urban equitable development could conflict with existing economic development projects, creating tensions between urban communities and developers or investors."
