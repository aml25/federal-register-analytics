    "potential_concerns": [
      "The order's review process could delay ongoing federal investigations or prosecutions impacting defendants and individuals on probation/parole, potentially undermining justice outcomes.",
      "Efforts to identify politically motivated misconduct may subject intelligence community personnel and federal law enforcement officers to retrospective scrutiny that affects morale and operational effectiveness.",
      "The emphasis on political weaponization risks politicizing law enforcement oversight, possibly compromising impartial accountability and causing public distrust among U.S. citizens exercising protected rights.",
      "Noncompliance with document-retention policies could lead to legal challenges or limit transparency, negatively affecting formerly incarcerated individuals seeking redress or reinstatement.",
      "The broad language targeting past federal actions may inadvertently stall reforms or enforcement actions aimed at addressing current threats, thereby disadvantaging public safety interests."
