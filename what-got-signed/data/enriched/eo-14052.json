    "potential_concerns": [
      "The emphasis on high labor standards and union membership may limit opportunities for non-union workers and small businesses that cannot meet prevailing wage requirements or union-related conditions.",
      "Environmental justice communities may face delays or bureaucratic obstacles that could slow the equitable distribution of infrastructure investments intended to benefit them.",
      "Rural and tribal communities might experience challenges in accessing broadband and clean water improvements promptly due to coordination complexities among multiple government levels and agencies.",
      "Construction workers could be exposed to fluctuating demand and job insecurity as different projects come online, especially if funding or appropriations become uncertain over time.",
      "Small business owners in infrastructure-related sectors might incur increased compliance costs from Made-in-America requirements and other regulatory priorities, possibly impacting competitiveness."
