    "summary": "This executive order establishes a special three-member Emergency Board to investigate unresolved labor disputes between New Jersey Transit Rail and certain employee labor organizations. The Board will review final settlement offers from both sides and report to the President with recommendations to resolve the disputes. Until the Board submits its report, the parties must maintain current working conditions and refrain from making changes without agreement.",

      "The establishment of the Emergency Board may delay resolution of labor disputes, prolonging uncertainty and financial strain for transportation-workers and union-members.",
      "Mandating maintenance of existing working conditions could limit flexibility for both New Jersey Transit management and union-members in responding to evolving operational or economic challenges.",
      "If the Emergency Board's recommendations are not accepted by both parties, persistent labor unrest could disrupt transit services, negatively impacting transportation-workers’ job security and working environment.",
      "The order might reduce the bargaining power of union-members by imposing an external board's decision, potentially leading to dissatisfaction or reduced morale among transportation-workers."
