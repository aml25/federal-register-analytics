    "summary": "This executive order updates and strengthens sanctions against foreign terrorists by consolidating and enhancing previous sanctions programs. It blocks property and financial transactions of terrorist individuals and entities, and authorizes stricter financial controls on foreign institutions supporting terrorism. The order also terminates an older national emergency declaration to streamline current counterterrorism efforts.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The enhanced sanctions could inadvertently restrict legitimate foreign nationals’ access to financial services, harming individuals and businesses not involved in terrorism.",
      "Financial institutions and their employees may face increased operational risks and compliance costs due to strict correspondents account restrictions and broad definitions of supportive activities.",
      "Overbroad designation criteria may lead to wrongful blocking of property or financial transactions of entities or persons with tenuous or indirect connections to terrorism, affecting innocent foreign nationals and businesses.",
      "The termination and consolidation of prior emergency declarations may create transitional confusion among global financial institutions, potentially delaying lawful transactions and harming global commerce.",
      "Heightened sanctions enforcement risks diplomatic tensions with foreign governments and international organizations, particularly if entities deemed compliant with UN Security Council resolutions are targeted, affecting broader foreign relations."
