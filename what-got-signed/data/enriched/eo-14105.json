      "Prohibiting certain transactions involving covered national security technologies could unintentionally disrupt collaboration and innovation pipelines, negatively affecting defense-industry-workers and technology-workers reliant on international partnerships.",
      "The designation of specific countries of concern and restrictions targeting citizens of those countries may raise concerns about fairness and potential diplomatic friction, affecting international relations and trade.",
      "Notification and compliance requirements could impose significant administrative burdens on corporations and investors, potentially deterring legitimate foreign investment and complicating capital flows in sensitive sectors."
