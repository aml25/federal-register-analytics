      "The order's support for interstate travel for abortion services may face legal and logistical challenges that could limit effective access for low-income women and Medicaid beneficiaries.",
      "Healthcare workers might experience increased legal and professional risk or confusion due to varying state abortion restrictions and federal non-discrimination enforcement efforts.",
      "Expanding enforcement of non-discrimination laws might provoke resistance or reluctance among some healthcare providers, potentially reducing availability of comprehensive reproductive services.",
      "Efforts to improve data collection on reproductive healthcare outcomes could raise privacy concerns for patients, especially among vulnerable populations receiving sensitive care."
