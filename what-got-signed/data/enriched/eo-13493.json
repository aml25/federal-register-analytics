The goal is to ensure detention policies align with U.S. national security, foreign policy, and justice interests.",

      "The order’s review may prolong uncertain detention conditions for detainees, negatively impacting detainees-prisoners-of-war and foreign nationals awaiting disposition.",
      "Interagency coordination challenges could delay implementation of lawful disposition options, increasing legal and human rights risks for detainees-prisoners-of-war.",
      "Recommendations balancing national security and justice interests might lead to restrictive detention policies that negatively affect foreign nationals without due process protections.",
      "The task force’s work may not adequately address detainees’ rights, raising concerns among human rights advocates and international observers about compliance with international law.",
      "Lack of transparency and limited input from affected populations could undermine legitimacy and acceptance of detention policies impacting foreign nationals and detainees."
