      "De-prioritizing enforcement of certain regulations may impede disaster response effectiveness, putting disaster-affected communities at increased risk.",
      "Though small business owners and entrepreneurs may benefit from reduced regulatory burdens, technology workers could face job insecurity if innovation-related regulations are cut too aggressively."
