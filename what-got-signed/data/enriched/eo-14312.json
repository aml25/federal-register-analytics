    "summary": "This executive order lifts most U.S. sanctions on Syria, recognizing changes under the new Syrian government and supporting efforts for stability and peace. It also maintains restrictions on terrorist groups and individuals linked to human rights abuses or illicit activities, while authorizing U.S. agencies to implement these changes and adjust sanctions as needed.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Lifting most U.S. sanctions on Syria may be perceived as legitimizing the new Syrian government, raising concerns among terrorism-victims-survivors and foreign governments about potential impunity for past human rights violations under the former regime.",
      "The revocation could unintentionally empower networks involved in illicit narcotics and captagon trafficking, adversely affecting refugees and human-trafficking victims by exacerbating regional instability and criminal activity.",
      "Relaxing export controls and sanctions might create challenges for corporations-businesses in monitoring compliance, increasing legal risks if inadvertently supporting blacklisted individuals or terrorist-linked entities despite maintained restrictions.",
      "Changes in U.S. policy towards Syria may complicate coordination with international-organizations and allied foreign-government-officials who remain skeptical of the new regime's commitments to peace and counterterrorism, potentially undermining unified diplomatic efforts."
