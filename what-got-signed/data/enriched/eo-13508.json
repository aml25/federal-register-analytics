      "Agricultural workers and small business owners in the Chesapeake Bay watershed may face increased regulatory burdens and costs due to stricter pollution control measures under agricultural and water pollution policies.",
      "Coastal and rural communities dependent on the Chesapeake Bay's natural resources might experience economic disruption during the transition to more sustainable practices, potentially affecting livelihoods in fishing, farming, and tourism sectors.",
      "Environmental justice communities could benefit from improved water quality and habitat restoration but may also confront challenges if implementation does not equitably address local needs or include meaningful community engagement.",
      "There is a risk that the focus on federal land management and storm water regulations may slow development projects or infrastructure improvements, impacting small businesses and agricultural operations in the region.",
      "Adaptation strategies to climate change could lead to changes in land use or conservation priorities that unintentionally displace or disadvantage certain rural or coastal populations."
