      "Extending the deadline for recognizing positive actions by the Government of Sudan may delay relief or improved diplomatic relations for Sudanese citizens and hinder timely humanitarian aid efforts.",
      "Maintaining certain sanctions with amendments might continue to restrict government officials in Sudan, potentially limiting incentives for reform or positive behavior.",
      "Revoking provisions of the prior executive order without clear alternatives could create policy ambiguity, complicating engagement for U.S. businesses or NGOs working in Sudan.",
      "Delays in U.S. recognition of Sudan's progress might contribute to ongoing instability or hinder conflict resolution efforts impacting Sudan’s civilian population."
