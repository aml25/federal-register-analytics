    "potential_concerns": [
      "Restrictions on security clearances and federal contracts related to Paul Weiss could disproportionately impact working-age adults employed by or affiliated with the firm, leading to job losses or reduced employment opportunities.",
      "Mandated disclosures and contract terminations involving Paul Weiss may create administrative burdens and financial strains for federal contractors and corporations doing business with the firm.",
      "Limiting official access and hiring restrictions may raise due process concerns for security-clearance holders associated with Paul Weiss who have not been proven to engage in misconduct, potentially affecting employment fairness.",
      "The order's broad anti-discrimination and national security justification might set precedents for restricting other law firms or entities, causing uncertainty and chilling effects across the private legal sector."
