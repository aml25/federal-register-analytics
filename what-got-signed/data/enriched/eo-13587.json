      "Coordination among multiple agencies might result in inconsistent or overly burdensome policies for federal contractors, creating operational and compliance difficulties.",
      "Technical safeguarding standards advancing rapidly could impose resource and adaptation challenges on federal contractors and clearance holders, possibly delaying necessary security improvements."
