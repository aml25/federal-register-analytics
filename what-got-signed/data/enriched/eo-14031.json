    "potential_concerns": [
      "Efforts to improve data disaggregation and focus on subpopulations within AA and NHPI communities may unintentionally expose individuals to privacy risks or stigmatization, particularly among vulnerable groups such as undocumented immigrants or those with intersecting marginalized identities.",
      "The initiative’s broad federal coordination might face challenges ensuring equitable resource allocation to low-income AA and NHPI families and small-business owners, risking inefficiencies or uneven benefits across diverse communities.",
      "Addressing anti-Asian hate crimes and bias through federal programs may lead to concerns about surveillance or policing practices that could disproportionately impact certain AA and NHPI subgroups or unintentionally exacerbate racial profiling.",
      "Efforts to improve language access and culturally competent health services for AA and NHPI communities, including medicaid beneficiaries and individuals with disabilities, may be underfunded or inconsistently implemented at the local level, limiting their effectiveness.",
      "The two-year term limitation of the Commission risks disrupting continuity of initiatives and stakeholder trust among AA and NHPI communities, especially for long-term issues such as health disparities or economic opportunity."
