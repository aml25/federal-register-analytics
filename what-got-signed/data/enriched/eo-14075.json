      "Efforts to eliminate conversion therapy and promote inclusive healthcare might face legal and political challenges in states with opposing laws, potentially limiting LGBTQI+ youth's access to affirming care.",
      "Expanding data collection on sexual orientation and gender identity, while intended to improve equity, could risk privacy breaches or misuse of sensitive information especially for vulnerable LGBTQI+ individuals.",
      "Policies encouraging family counseling and support for LGBTQI+ youth may be resisted by some families or communities, limiting effectiveness and potentially causing increased familial conflict.",
      "Strengthening non-discrimination protections and inclusive child welfare practices may face resistance from some state agencies or foster families, complicating efforts to reduce LGBTQI+ youth over-representation in hostile environments.",
      "Initiatives addressing LGBTQI+ homelessness could be underfunded or inconsistently applied, leaving many low-income or homeless LGBTQI+ youth and families without adequate support or housing stability."
