    "summary": "This executive order expands sanctions and restrictions on investments, trade, and financial dealings related to Nicaragua, targeting individuals and sectors involved in undermining democratic freedoms and human rights. It prohibits certain imports, exports, and investments connected to Nicaragua’s gold sector and other designated areas to pressure the Nicaraguan government regarding its repressive actions.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The expansion of sanctions targeting Nicaragua's gold and other economic sectors could severely harm Nicaraguan citizens' livelihoods, particularly small-business owners and workers, by constraining economic opportunities and increasing poverty.",
      "Restrictions on imports and exports may negatively impact investors and U.S. businesses engaging in trade with Nicaragua, potentially leading to financial losses and reduced foreign investment.",
      "The explicit protection against the prosecution or arrest of journalists and media outlets exercising freedom of expression is critical but may lead to challenges in identifying legitimate press versus politically motivated actors, complicating enforcement and diplomatic relations.",
      "Increased sanctions might inadvertently exacerbate human-trafficking vulnerabilities in Nicaragua by destabilizing the economy and limiting resources for vulnerable populations, including human trafficking victims.",
      "The order's broad delegation to Treasury and Commerce Secretaries to define prohibited sectors may lead to unpredictable and uneven application of sanctions, impacting a wide range of economic actors and citizens in Nicaragua unpredictably."
