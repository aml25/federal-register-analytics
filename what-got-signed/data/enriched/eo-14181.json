      "Efforts to override state and local water policies to increase water delivery in Southern California may exacerbate conflicts with environmental protections, potentially harming environmental justice communities within disaster-affected urban areas.",
      "The restriction that FEMA preparedness grants shall not be used to support undocumented immigrants may delay or limit disaster relief and housing assistance for vulnerable undocumented individuals displaced by wildfires in California.",
      "Accelerated removal of debris and expedited infrastructure projects risk insufficient environmental review, possibly causing unintended environmental degradation or displacement in low-income urban communities.",
      "The focus on maximizing water deliveries and hydropower generation might prioritize certain communities over others, risking inequitable allocation of resources to renters and homeowners in urban disaster-affected areas.",
      "Investigation and potential actions against misuse of federal grants by the City of Los Angeles could disrupt ongoing disaster recovery efforts, impacting displaced families dependent on timely housing relief."
