    "potential_concerns": [
      "Greater coordination under the National Space Council might prioritize defense and intelligence goals, potentially limiting transparency and shifting resources away from pure scientific research, affecting scientific researchers and technology workers.",
      "The focus on national security information classification could create barriers for entrepreneurs and startups due to restricted access to space-related data and technologies, potentially hindering innovation in the private sector.",
      "Close coordination among civil, commercial, and national security space sectors might raise concerns about the militarization of space and the influence of defense industry workers on policy priorities, possibly sidelining peaceful and commercial space exploration interests.",
      "Interagency coordination requirements may result in bureaucratic delays that impact technology workers and entrepreneurs actively developing new space technologies, slowing down commercialization and innovation efforts."
