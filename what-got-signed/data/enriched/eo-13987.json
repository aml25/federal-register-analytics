It also establishes roles to lead the U.S. global health response and improve preparedness for future biological and pandemic threats through better coordination among federal agencies and state, local, tribal, and territorial authorities.",

      "Coordinating with diverse state, local, tribal, and territorial governments may pose challenges due to differing policies, priorities, and capacities.",
      "Use of the Defense Production Act and supply chain coordination could face pushback from industry and logistical bottlenecks.",
      "Potential overlap or confusion between roles of the COVID-19 Response Coordinator and National Security Council officials might complicate decision-making."
