    "summary": "This executive order lifts a temporary suspension on the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) with new and enhanced screening and vetting procedures to better protect national security. It directs relevant agencies to continue monitoring risks posed by certain refugee categories and requires periodic assessments and reports on the program’s impact on U.S. safety.",

      "Ongoing risk assessments may result in the suspension or modification of refugee admissions from specific countries, directly affecting citizens-of-specific-countries-by-eo-designation and limiting their access to refuge.",
      "Interagency coordination and intelligence-sharing enhancements might raise privacy concerns or lead to errors that unjustifiably deny refugee status to eligible applicants."
