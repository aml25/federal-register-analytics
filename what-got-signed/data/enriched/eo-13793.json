    "summary": "This executive order directs the Department of Veterans Affairs to create an Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection aimed at improving oversight, disciplining employees who violate veterans' trust, and protecting whistleblowers from retaliation. The office will also help resolve complaints of wrongdoing and recommend needed legislative changes to enhance accountability within the VA.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The order’s emphasis on disciplining VA employees may create a workplace environment of fear or reduced morale among federal employees at the VA, potentially undermining workforce stability.",
      "Whistleblowers may face challenges if protections are inconsistently applied or if the Office lacks sufficient resources, which could deter reporting of wrongdoing and compromise veterans' healthcare quality.",
      "Veterans could experience improved service accountability, but disruptions from employee disciplinary actions might temporarily impact continuity of care or access to services.",
      "Identifying and addressing statutory barriers may require legislative changes that could delay the Office’s full effectiveness, limiting timely improvements in VA accountability and whistleblower protection."
