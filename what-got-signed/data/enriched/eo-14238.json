    "summary": "This executive order directs certain federal agencies and entities to eliminate non-essential components and reduce staffing and budget to the minimum legally required level. It requires agency heads to report on compliance and authorizes budget authorities to reject funding requests that are inconsistent with these reductions. The goal is to continue the effort to shrink parts of the federal bureaucracy that the President has deemed unnecessary.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The mandated reduction of personnel and functions in agencies such as the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness and the Minority Business Development Agency could lead to diminished support and services for homeless individuals and minority-owned businesses, negatively impacting low-income individuals and families.",
      "Cuts to federal employees' jobs in affected agencies may lead to job loss and decreased workforce morale among federal employees, increasing challenges in executing essential statutory functions.",
      "Elimination of non-essential agency components might unintentionally reduce capacity for delivering critical programs, undermining efforts to assist vulnerable populations like homeless/unhoused individuals and impairing economic development initiatives for minority communities.",
      "Restricting budget requests and funding for these agencies could hinder their ability to comply with legal mandates, posing risks to legally required services benefiting disadvantaged populations."
