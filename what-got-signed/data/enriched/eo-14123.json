      "Efforts to prioritize domestic manufacturing and supply chain diversification may increase costs or disrupt existing supplier relationships, potentially impacting small-business-owners' competitiveness and operational stability.",
      "Initiatives to empower workers and enforce worker-rights protections could lead to increased regulatory burdens or labor disputes affecting manufacturing-workers and union-members.",
      "The focus on building resilient supply chains might unintentionally concentrate economic activity in certain regions, exacerbating inequalities for working-age-adults in economically distressed or rural communities.",
      "Enhanced supply chain security protocols may lengthen procurement timelines or reduce the availability of some goods, adversely affecting agricultural-workers-farmers dependent on timely inputs.",
      "Complex interagency coordination could slow decision-making processes, delaying critical actions that impact the livelihoods of manufacturing-workers and small-business-owners reliant on stable supply chains."
