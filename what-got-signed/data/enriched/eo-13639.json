      "Minority language populations such as Hispanic/Latino Americans and African Americans may not receive adequate targeted support in voter education, limiting the effectiveness of language-access provisions.",
      "The commission's advisory nature and six-month timeline might constrain the depth and feasibility of recommendations, limiting long-term impact on election administration improvements for all eligible voters."
