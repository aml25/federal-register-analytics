It also supersedes a previous order on pay rates and directs the Office of Personnel Management to implement locality-based pay adjustments.",

      "Complexity in implementing multiple schedules and pay systems could lead to administrative errors affecting the timely and accurate compensation of impacted federal employees and service members."
