      "Veterans might experience indirect effects if amendments alter precedents or standards that impact post-service adjudications or benefits connected to military justice outcomes.",
      "The amendments may create challenges in uniform application across different service branches, risking inconsistent disciplinary actions and potentially undermining force readiness.",
      "Service members unfamiliar with amended provisions could face unintended legal vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for comprehensive and timely training on the new rules."
