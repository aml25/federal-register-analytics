      "The comprehensive rebuilding efforts might inadequately prioritize low-income individuals and renters, potentially prolonging displacement in disaster-affected communities.",
      "Coordination among numerous federal agencies could cause delays or bureaucratic obstacles that hinder timely support for tribal communities and local jurisdictions.",
      "Without clear accountability measures, rebuilding funds might be inefficiently allocated, impacting the quality and resilience of housing and infrastructure for disaster-affected populations.",
      "Efforts to rebuild infrastructure with future climate resilience in mind may overlook immediate economic recovery needs for affected homeowners and small businesses.",
      "Engagement with tribal communities could be insufficient, risking failure to fully incorporate tribal priorities and cultural considerations into the rebuilding strategy."
