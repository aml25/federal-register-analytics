    "potential_concerns": [
      "The continued operation of the advisory group could lead to policy recommendations that prioritize prevention and health promotion but may overlook challenges faced by vulnerable populations such as medicaid beneficiaries and patients with chronic illnesses.",
      "Implementation of recommendations from the advisory group might inadvertently widen disparities if prevention programs are not equitably accessible to low-income or marginalized groups within the ACA marketplace enrollees.",
      "The extended timeline for the advisory group could delay more immediate public health actions needed by patients-general and those with chronic illnesses awaiting guidance tailored to urgent health concerns.",
      "There may be insufficient mechanisms to incorporate diverse patient voices, particularly from marginalized populations, which could limit the effectiveness of health promotion strategies intended to benefit broad segments of the population."
