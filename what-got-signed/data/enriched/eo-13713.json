    "summary": "This executive order mandates a half-day closure for all executive branch departments and agencies on December 24, 2015, allowing employees to be excused from work during the last half of the day before Christmas. It permits agency heads to keep certain functions open for essential services related to national security or other critical needs. The order also addresses how the day counts for employee pay and leave.",

      "Some federal employees might receive reduced pay or leave accrual if hours are not properly accounted for on the half-day closure.",
      "Military personnel on active duty may experience staffing challenges or increased operational demands if exempted from the closure, affecting military readiness.",
      "Essential federal workers required to remain on duty might face morale issues or perceptions of unfair treatment compared to excused employees.",
      "Inconsistent application by agency heads regarding exemptions for national security or critical functions could lead to employee confusion or claims of inequity."
