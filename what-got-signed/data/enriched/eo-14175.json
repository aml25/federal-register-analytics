    "summary": "This executive order directs the U.S. government to designate Ansar Allah (the Houthis) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization due to their attacks on U.S. personnel, regional partners, and civilian infrastructure. It sets deadlines for government agencies to submit reports, take designation actions, and review U.S. aid relationships to ensure no funding supports the group.",

      "Muslim-American communities might face increased stigmatization or discrimination due to association with the designated group.",
      "The review and termination of USAID partnerships might disrupt essential services and create operational challenges for humanitarian actors in Yemen.",
      "Implementation delays or disagreements among agencies could slow the designation process and reduce the order's intended effectiveness."
