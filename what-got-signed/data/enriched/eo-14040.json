      "Declassification could inadvertently reveal sensitive intelligence sources or methods, risking future national security and impacting U.S. citizens' safety.",
      "Releasing information related to 9/11 investigations might retraumatize terrorism victims and survivors by exposing distressing new details.",
      "Disclosure could lead to diplomatic tensions if documents expose foreign government involvements, indirectly affecting U.S. citizens through altered foreign relations.",
      "The order's requirement to balance transparency with security may lead to inconsistent declassification decisions, causing public distrust among U.S. citizens and survivors.",
      "Delays or incomplete disclosures due to classification disputes might frustrate terrorism victims and survivors seeking full accountability and closure."
