    "summary": "This executive order reimposes U.S. economic sanctions on Iran that were lifted under the 2015 nuclear agreement, targeting Iran's energy, automotive, shipping sectors, financial institutions, and individuals involved in activities the U.S. government considers harmful, such as human rights abuses, terrorism support, and nuclear proliferation. It authorizes various U.S. agencies to block property, restrict financial transactions, and deny visas to individuals and entities connected to these activities, aiming to pressure Iran economically and politically.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The reimposition of sanctions targeting Iran's energy, automotive, shipping sectors, and financial institutions may cause significant job losses and economic hardship for Iranian citizens and workers in these sectors (citizens-of-specific-countries-by-eo-designation, energy-sector-workers-oil-gas-coal, automotive-industry-workers, maritime-port-workers).",
      "Sanctions on financial institutions facilitating transactions with Iran could disrupt global banking operations and pose challenges for financial-services-workers due to increased compliance burdens and potential loss of business.",
      "Restrictions on visa issuance and travel bans for individuals linked to the Iranian government or entities may negatively affect visa holders, including students and temporary workers, potentially stranding some or disrupting their educational and professional plans (visa-holders-work-student-tourist, foreign-nationals-general).",
      "Unintended humanitarian impacts may arise from stringent enforcement, potentially exacerbating shortages of essential goods like food and medicine for the Iranian population despite exemptions, indirectly harming vulnerable populations within Iran.",
      "Broader geopolitical tensions caused by these sanctions might lead to retaliatory measures affecting U.S. businesses engaged in international trade or global financial institutions with Iran-linked interests."
