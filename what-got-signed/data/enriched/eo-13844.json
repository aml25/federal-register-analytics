      "Enhanced enforcement against corporate fraud and digital currency fraud could lead to increased compliance costs and legal burdens for corporations and corporate executives.",
      "Consumers, especially seniors and veterans, might benefit from improved fraud protections but could also face restricted access or increased scrutiny in purchasing digital assets.",
      "Increased coordination among federal, state, local, and tribal authorities might lead to inconsistent enforcement standards or jurisdictional conflicts affecting businesses operating across multiple regions.",
      "Cryptocurrency and digital asset holders may experience heightened regulatory scrutiny that could inadvertently stifle innovation or market participation."
