    "potential_concerns": [
      "The imposition of sanctions and asset blocks on foreign government officials and corporations could trigger diplomatic tensions or retaliatory measures adversely affecting U.S. geopolitical interests under the theme of foreign-election-interference and economic-sanctions.",
      "Targeted foreign entities might use covert methods or proxy organizations to circumvent sanctions, undermining the order's effectiveness and complicating law enforcement efforts related to homeland-security.",
      "The broad discretion granted for sanctioning may raise concerns about misidentification or insufficient evidence supporting interference, potentially harming foreign individuals or businesses unjustly and harming international relations.",
      "U.S. citizens may face indirect economic consequences if sanctions against large foreign corporations impact global supply chains, markets, or business partnerships, affecting their economic well-being under national-emergencies and economic-sanctions themes."
