    "potential_concerns": [
      "Expanding the number of Presidential Scholars recognized for career and technical education may inadvertently prioritize certain career fields over others, potentially marginalizing students pursuing less traditional vocational paths among youth and students.",
      "The selection process might unintentionally favor students from more resourced educational institutions, creating disparities impacting underrepresented youth-young-adults and k-12-students from low-income or rural communities.",
      "Increasing recognition without corresponding resource investments may create expectations among students and educational institutions that cannot be met, leading to frustration or decreased motivation among college-university-students.",
      "The focus on career and technical education fields might overshadow traditional academic achievement, potentially creating tension among k-12-students and youth-young-adults who excel in non-technical disciplines."
