    "summary": "This order updates and narrows the list of agricultural products that are exempt from reciprocal tariffs imposed to address large trade deficits. It adjusts tariff schedules to exclude certain agricultural goods from previous tariffs, effective November 13, 2025, in order to better manage trade relations and domestic economic needs under a national emergency related to trade deficits.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Excluding certain agricultural products from reciprocal tariffs may benefit U.S. farmers and small agricultural businesses but could weaken bargaining power in trade negotiations with foreign governments.",
      "Adjustments to tariff schedules may disrupt supply chains for corporations relying on imported agricultural inputs, potentially increasing costs and affecting product prices.",
      "The national emergency designation could lead to prolonged trade restrictions, causing uncertainties for foreign governments and their businesses, possibly provoking retaliatory trade measures.",
      "Domestic producers of agricultural goods not exempted from tariffs may face competitive disadvantages compared to exempted products, impacting agricultural workers unevenly."
