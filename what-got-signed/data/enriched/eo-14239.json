It mandates the development and regular updating of a National Resilience Strategy, a National Risk Register, and revisions to existing preparedness and continuity policies to improve efficiency and resilience across the country.",

      "Increased emphasis on state and local preparedness may disproportionately burden low-income individuals and families who lack resources to effectively prepare for disasters, especially in rural communities with limited infrastructure support.",
      "Rural and disaster-affected communities might face delays or gaps in federal assistance due to the shift toward state and local autonomy, potentially exacerbating vulnerabilities during large-scale emergencies.",
      "State and local governments may struggle with the technical and financial demands of implementing updated resilience strategies and risk registers, risking incomplete or uneven protection across regions.",
      "Citizens might experience confusion or inconsistency in preparedness policies as the federal government moves from an all-hazards approach to a risk-informed, localized management style, leading to potential gaps in national coordination."
