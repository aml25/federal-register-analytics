      "Efforts to expand equity and engagement with Asian Americans and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities may raise concerns over adequate resource allocation and representation on advisory committees.",
      "Continued operation of environmental justice advisory councils may unintentionally delay urgent environmental remediation actions by requiring extended coordination and review processes, impacting environmental justice communities.",
      "The extension and amendment of advisory committees focused on educational equity for African American, Hispanic, and other minority students may face challenges in translating advisory recommendations into measurable policy outcomes for HBCU students and underserved tribal communities.",
      "Increased liaison roles between advisory councils and local or private entities may risk uneven engagement quality across regions, potentially marginalizing rural tribal communities and veterans who rely on consistent federal support."
