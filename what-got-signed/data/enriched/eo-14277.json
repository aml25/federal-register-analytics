    "potential_concerns": [
      "There is a risk that underserved and rural k-12 students may not equally benefit from AI educational resources and competitions due to disparities in technology access and school funding.",
      "Teachers and educators may face increased workload and demand for rapid AI training, potentially without sufficient support or time, which could affect teaching quality and job satisfaction.",
      "Working-age adults and youth in low-income or marginalized communities might encounter barriers in accessing apprenticeship programs and certifications due to geographic, economic, or informational constraints.",
      "The emphasis on AI skills might lead to neglect of other critical educational areas or vocational training not AI-related, possibly disadvantaging students and workers pursuing alternative career pathways."
