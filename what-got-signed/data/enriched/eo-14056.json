    "potential_concerns": [
      "Coordination led by the National Space Council could centralize space policy in ways that slow innovation or disadvantage private-sector technology workers and scientific researchers.",
      "Prioritizing national security space activities may inadvertently limit resources or opportunities for civil and commercial space sectors, affecting technology workers and defense-industry workers differently.",
      "The involvement of classified national security information in space policy could reduce transparency and limit input from commercial and scientific communities, potentially undermining broader industry engagement.",
      "Emphasis on interagency coordination risks bureaucratic delays that could affect timely advancement and competitiveness for U.S. veterans transitioning into aerospace and defense technology jobs.",
      "The executive order’s direction for agencies to conform space activities to the President’s policy may restrict independent research initiatives by scientific researchers working in government-funded programs."
