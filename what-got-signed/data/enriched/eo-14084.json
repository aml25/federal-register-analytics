    "potential_concerns": [
      "Efforts to promote equity and access in arts and humanities for underserved communities may struggle due to inconsistent interagency coordination and potential resource limitations, affecting the impact on tribal communities and other marginalized groups.",
      "Enhanced federal support for arts and humanities might prioritize certain cultural expressions or histories over others, causing unintended exclusion or underrepresentation of particular racial or ethnic communities within the broader category of underserved populations.",
      "Integrating arts and humanities initiatives into health, climate, and civic programs could dilute focus or create mission creep, potentially limiting the effectiveness of specialized services intended for veterans and children in educational settings.",
      "The establishment of a committee with non-federal members risks privileging well-connected individuals or organizations, which might marginalize grassroots artists and educators from underserved or rural communities."
