    "potential_concerns": [
      "The rapid deployment of advanced nuclear reactors on military installations may raise safety, environmental, and health concerns for nearby rural and environmental justice communities due to potential radiation risks or nuclear accidents.",
      "Prioritizing nuclear technology exports to allies and partners might heighten geopolitical tensions and complicate adherence to international nonproliferation agreements, impacting global diplomatic relations.",
      "The focus on private sector investment and large corporations could marginalize smaller nuclear technology startups or local renewable energy initiatives, affecting the diversity of the energy sector workforce.",
      "Accelerated siting and construction timelines may pressure regulatory bodies and risk insufficient community engagement, leading to public distrust particularly in communities near proposed reactor sites."
