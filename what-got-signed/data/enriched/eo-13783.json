    "summary": "This executive order directs U.S. federal agencies to review and roll back regulations that restrict domestic energy production, including oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear power. It rescinds certain climate-related policies and focuses on promoting affordable, reliable, and secure energy while ensuring environmental regulations are cost-effective and grounded in sound science. The order also calls for lifting coal leasing moratoriums and reassessing rules related to emissions and clean energy plans.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Rolling back environmental regulations and lifting the coal leasing moratorium may benefit energy-sector-workers-oil-gas-coal and small-business-owners but could worsen pollution and health risks for environmental-justice-communities and tribal-communities-reservations.",
      "Reducing emphasis on climate-related policies and rescinding the social cost of carbon metrics might hinder growth and job security for renewable-energy-workers, contradicting the goal of affordable and clean energy.",
      "Rural-communities could face increased environmental degradation and economic inequality due to expanded fossil fuel development without adequate protections.",
      "The deregulation focus could result in unintended long-term environmental harms that disproportionately affect vulnerable populations such as environmental-justice-communities and tribal-communities-reservations, despite short-term economic gains for the energy industry.",
      "The order’s broad call to suspend or rescind regulations may create regulatory uncertainty that complicates business planning for both small-business-owners and federal contractors involved in energy development."
