    "summary": "This executive order creates the National Energy Dominance Council within the White House to coordinate efforts across federal agencies to increase U.S. energy production and achieve energy dominance. The Council advises the President on policies to expand reliable, affordable energy sources, improve permitting and infrastructure processes, encourage private sector investment, and strengthen national energy security.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The emphasis on expanding oil, gas, and fossil fuel production (natural-gas-fracking, oil-and-gas-development) may adversely impact environmental justice communities and tribal communities through increased pollution and habitat disruption.",
      "Efforts to cut regulatory red tape and speed permitting (infrastructure-permitting) could undermine environmental safeguards, potentially harming rural communities that depend on natural resources and clean environments.",
      "Prioritizing rapid energy production to achieve energy dominance may increase greenhouse gas emissions, conflicting with climate goals and disproportionately affecting communities near energy infrastructure expansions.",
      "The focus on incentivizing private sector investment could favor large corporations and exclude small businesses lacking capital, potentially concentrating economic benefits and limiting inclusive job growth for working-age adults."
