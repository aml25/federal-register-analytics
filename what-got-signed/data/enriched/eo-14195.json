    "summary": "This executive order imposes a 10% tariff on all products imported from China to address the flow of synthetic opioids, like fentanyl, originating there and harming the United States. It declares a national emergency related to this drug crisis and authorizes U.S. agencies to take actions to enforce this order until China takes sufficient steps to stop the illicit opioid supply chain.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The imposed 10% tariff on all Chinese imports may increase costs for small-business-owners and large-corporation-employees, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers.",
      "Law enforcement officers at federal and state/local levels may face increased operational challenges and resource demands in enforcing the expanded national emergency and addressing opioid-related crime.",
      "Healthcare workers might experience continued strain due to persistent or shifting opioid supply dynamics if the tariffs do not effectively reduce synthetic opioid inflows.",
      "U.S. citizens could face unintended economic consequences from retaliatory tariffs imposed by China, which may worsen domestic economic conditions.",
      "The order’s broad tariff application risks disrupting legitimate trade and supply chains unrelated to synthetic opioids, burdening businesses and consumers not involved in illicit activities."
