    "potential_concerns": [
      "Lowering IVF costs and expanding access may raise ethical concerns among certain faith-based communities, particularly regarding the handling and disposition of unused embryos.",
      "Efforts to reduce costs might result in insurance or healthcare providers imposing stricter eligibility criteria, potentially limiting access for some infertile patients.",
      "The focus on affordability could lead to increased demand for IVF services that existing healthcare infrastructure may not be prepared to support, adversely affecting patient experience.",
      "Without clear regulatory guidance, efforts to ease statutory barriers might lead to variability in IVF quality and safety standards impacting patients.",
      "Populations with limited healthcare coverage, such as Medicaid beneficiaries or uninsured individuals, might still face access barriers despite overall cost reductions."
