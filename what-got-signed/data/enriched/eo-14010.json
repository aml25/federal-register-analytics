      "Implementation could face challenges due to the complexity of coordinating multiple agencies and international partners with differing priorities.",
      "Critics may argue that the order does not sufficiently address border enforcement concerns or could encourage increased migration.",
      "Restoring asylum processes may be limited by public health constraints or resource capacity at the border.",
      "Revoking previous policies and regulations could create legal uncertainties or transitional disruptions affecting immigration courts and enforcement.",
      "Efforts to address root causes may take significant time before yielding measurable migration reductions, leading to short-term political and operational pressures."
