    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to stop using taxpayer dollars to fund or promote elective abortions, aligning with the Hyde Amendment. It also revokes two previous executive orders that allowed federal funding for such abortions and requires the Office of Management and Budget to issue guidance for implementing these changes.",

      "Restricting federal funding for elective abortions may disproportionately burden low-income women and uninsured individuals who rely on Medicaid or other federally supported healthcare programs.",
      "The revocation of prior executive orders could lead to confusion or gaps in reproductive health services for vulnerable populations, particularly affecting women in rural or underserved communities.",
      "Limiting federal funds could increase out-of-pocket costs for abortion services, potentially forcing women to delay or forgo care, negatively impacting their health outcomes.",
      "Healthcare providers participating in federally funded programs may face challenges maintaining comprehensive reproductive health services, reducing access and quality for marginalized women."
