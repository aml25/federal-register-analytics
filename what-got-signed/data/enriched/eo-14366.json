    "potential_concerns": [
      "Efforts to limit proxy advisors' incorporation of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors could reduce transparency for investors, particularly impacting middle-class Americans and seniors relying on retirement plans.",
      "Increased regulatory scrutiny and potential registration requirements may impose burdens on proxy advisory firms and financial services workers, possibly reducing competition and innovation in the industry.",
      "Revisions discouraging consideration of non-pecuniary factors may conflict with the fiduciary duties under ERISA, leading to legal uncertainty for pension plan managers and affecting investor protections.",
      "Limiting influence of foreign-owned proxy advisors may unintentionally reduce alternative perspectives in shareholder voting advice, potentially impacting the quality of information available to corporations and investors."
