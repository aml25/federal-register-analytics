    "summary": "This executive order directs the Federal Aviation Administration to update rules to allow and regulate supersonic flight over land, which has been banned for decades due to noise concerns. It also coordinates government research to advance supersonic technology, and promotes international cooperation to align regulations for safe and efficient supersonic air travel.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Relaxing supersonic flight regulations may increase noise pollution over urban and suburban communities, raising environmental justice concerns for populations already burdened by industrial or aviation noise.",
      "Advancement and deregulation of supersonic technology could disproportionately benefit well-funded entrepreneurs and large aviation corporations while limiting access or affordability for broader populations.",
      "International regulatory coordination challenges under the theme of international-agreements-treaties may create barriers for startups and technology workers attempting to scale supersonic innovations globally.",
      "Operational integration of supersonic aircraft into the National Airspace System could create air-traffic management complexity affecting airline and aviation workers, potentially increasing safety risks during transition periods."
