      "The expansion of Medicaid eligibility and ACA subsidies may strain state budgets, especially in states that have not expanded Medicaid, potentially limiting access improvements for some low-income individuals and families.",
      "Efforts to reduce documentation and enrollment barriers might lead to increased fraud or administrative errors, affecting the sustainability of coverage for medicaid-beneficiaries and aca-marketplace-enrollees.",
      "While extending postpartum Medicaid coverage benefits women, especially from low-income groups, there could be challenges in ensuring sufficient provider networks to meet increased demand for maternal healthcare services.",
      "The policy focus on lowering out-of-pocket costs could inadvertently shift costs to healthcare providers or insurers, possibly resulting in reduced provider participation or higher premiums over time, impacting individuals with disabilities and chronic illnesses reliant on consistent care.",
      "Individuals with mental health conditions might face uneven access to the proposed mobile crisis intervention services if implementation varies by state, potentially exacerbating disparities in behavioral health care access."
