    "potential_concerns": [
      "The revocation of diversity, equity, and inclusion policies in favor of merit-based hiring may reduce workplace opportunities and support for historically marginalized groups, including women and multiracial Americans.",
      "The firm’s political neutrality requirement could limit advocacy or legal representation for causes aligned with civil rights enforcement, potentially impacting the advancement of equality initiatives.",
      "While the order dedicates pro bono services to veterans and combating anti-Semitism, there could be unintended neglect of broader civil rights issues affecting other racial and ethnic minorities.",
      "Relying on voluntary firm commitments without enforceable legal mechanisms might result in inconsistent implementation and limited accountability in fulfilling pro bono and fairness goals."
