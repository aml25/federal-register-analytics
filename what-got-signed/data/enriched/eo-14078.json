      "The imposition of sanctions and travel restrictions on foreign government officials may strain diplomatic relations and complicate ongoing hostage negotiations, potentially prolonging detentions and negatively affecting hostages and their families.",
      "Families of hostages and wrongfully detained nationals might experience inconsistent information or insufficient support if interagency coordination lapses despite the order's intent, impacting the well-being of these U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents.",
      "The broad designation authority for sanctions could lead to unintended targeting of individuals with tangential connections, raising humanitarian and legal concerns for those foreign officials whose actions may not be fully culpable.",
      "Heightened national emergency status and economic sanctions might escalate tensions with foreign states, inadvertently increasing risks for additional wrongful detentions or hostage-taking of U.S. nationals abroad."
