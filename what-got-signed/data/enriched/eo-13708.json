    "potential_concerns": [
      "The continuation of numerous advisory committees could inadvertently perpetuate bureaucratic inefficiencies, delaying timely input from key populations such as environmental-justice-communities and small-business-owners seeking policy guidance.",
      "Populations like individuals-with-disabilities and hbcu-students-communities might not see sufficient representation or substantive policy change despite the advisory committees’ existence, limiting the positive impact on those historically underserved groups.",
      "The reestablishment of advisory groups related to labor-management relations and federal labor policy might lead to conflicts or perceived biases affecting union-members and veterans engaged in workforce transition programs.",
      "Faith-based-communities involved in advisory roles could face challenges balancing diverse religious perspectives, potentially causing unintended exclusion of minority religious or secular groups.",
      "There is a risk that national monuments and cultural preservation advisory committees may prioritize certain demographic interests (e.g., african-americans-black-americans, native-americans-indigenous-peoples) unevenly, leading to disputes or dissatisfaction among marginalized ethnic populations."
