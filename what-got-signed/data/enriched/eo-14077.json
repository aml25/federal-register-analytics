      "The establishment of the Emergency Board may pressure union-members to accept terms that limit their negotiating power, affecting labor-management relations negatively.",
      "Delays or failure to resolve disputes promptly could disrupt rail transportation, adversely impacting working-age-adults reliant on these services for commuting and commerce.",
      "Large corporation employees involved in railroad companies might face operational and financial challenges due to the temporary maintenance of working conditions during the dispute timeframe.",
      "The order’s mandated freeze on changes to working conditions may unintentionally prolong labor tensions, risking escalation or reduced morale among transportation-workers."
