    "summary": "This executive order establishes a White House Initiative to support Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) by increasing their access to federal resources, improving their capacity to deliver quality education, and promoting economic opportunities for Hispanic and Latino students. It also creates a President's Board of Advisors to provide guidance on policies that enhance the success and visibility of these institutions.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Implementation challenges may arise if HSIs are unable to fully access or compete for federal resources due to existing bureaucratic barriers, potentially limiting the policy's impact on Hispanic and Latino college students from low-income backgrounds.",
      "There could be unintended disparities created between HSIs and non-HSIs in federal funding allocation, possibly fostering perceptions of inequity among broader higher education communities.",
      "The focus on increasing STEM and bilingual education opportunities at HSIs may strain institutional capacity and resources, affecting the quality of programs and student outcomes if not matched by adequate funding increases.",
      "Without sufficient oversight, increased federal resource access might not translate into improved educational equity for low-income Hispanic and Latino students if institutional structures fail to effectively implement evidence-based practices."
