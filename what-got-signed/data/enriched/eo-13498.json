      "The emphasis on faith-based organizations could raise concerns about preserving the constitutional principle of separation of church and state, possibly affecting religious minorities and secular communities.",
      "Low-income individuals relying on federally funded social services may face uneven service quality if accountability and evaluation standards are not rigorously enforced across all providers.",
      "Formerly incarcerated individuals might benefit from increased reentry support, but inconsistencies in program implementation may create disparities in access to second-chance employment and mentorship.",
      "Nonprofit organizations could experience increased administrative burdens related to federal oversight, evaluation requirements, and compliance with constitutional safeguards, potentially limiting their operational capacity."
