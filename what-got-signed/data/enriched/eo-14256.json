    "summary": "This executive order imposes new duties on low-value shipments from the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong containing synthetic opioids or related products, closing a loophole that previously allowed such shipments to enter duty-free. It requires carriers to collect duties on postal shipments and strengthens enforcement measures to address the influx of synthetic opioids into the United States, effective May 2, 2025.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The imposition of duties on low-value imports from China and Hong Kong may raise costs for small-business-owners and corporations that rely on affordable goods, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers.",
      "Postal-workers could face increased operational burdens and complications due to new reporting, bonding, and duty collection requirements for international postal shipments.",
      "Enhanced enforcement aimed at disrupting the synthetic opioid supply chain may risk delaying legitimate shipments, inadvertently affecting supply chains and consumer access to lawful goods.",
      "While law enforcement and healthcare-workers may benefit from efforts to reduce synthetic opioid influx, disruption could push illicit trade to more dangerous channels, complicating public health and safety responses.",
      "The focus on packages from China and Hong Kong without immediate extension to Macau might create opportunities for circumvention, potentially undermining enforcement efforts and complicating law enforcement operations."
