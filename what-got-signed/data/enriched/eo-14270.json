    "potential_concerns": [
      "The mandated frequent expiration of energy regulations could lead to regulatory uncertainty, negatively impacting renewable energy workers and businesses that require stable rules for long-term investments.",
      "Environmental justice communities and tribal communities may face increased environmental risks if critical protective regulations are allowed to expire without adequate review or renewal.",
      "Rural and coastal communities reliant on stringent environmental and land management regulations might experience heightened exposure to pollution and resource depletion due to deregulation pressures.",
      "Small business owners and corporations in the energy sector may disproportionately benefit by cutting compliance costs, potentially at the expense of environmental safeguards and community health.",
      "The short review cycles may overwhelm agencies, risking rushed assessments that prioritize deregulatory goals over thorough environmental and public health evaluations affecting vulnerable populations."
