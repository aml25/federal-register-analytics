    "summary": "This executive order establishes a clear order of succession for who will serve as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security if the current Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Under Secretary for Management, and other designated officials are unable to serve. It also revokes prior conflicting succession orders and confirms the President's discretion to deviate from this order as allowed by law.",

      "Ambiguities in eligibility and acting capacity rules could delay prompt succession during a crisis.",
      "The order allows broad presidential discretion which may create uncertainty or political conflicts in succession scenarios.",
      "Officials serving in an acting capacity are excluded from succession, potentially limiting available experienced personnel.",
      "Revoking previous succession orders could cause transitional confusion if not clearly communicated to stakeholders.",
      "Implementation depends on availability of appropriations, which might restrict timely execution of duties during emergencies."
