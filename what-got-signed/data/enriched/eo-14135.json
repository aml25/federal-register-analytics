    "potential_concerns": [
      "The established order of succession could concentrate decision-making power within a small set of DHS officials, potentially sidelining other senior leaders and impacting agency accountability.",
      "If the designated succession includes officials who are serving in acting capacities or lack eligibility under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, this could create legal ambiguity and operational disruptions during critical homeland security incidents.",
      "The rigidity of the succession order may not adequately address rapidly evolving threat environments, possibly delaying effective leadership response that affects national security and public safety.",
      "Lack of transparency about the criteria for selecting lower-tier officials in the succession order might raise concerns among related communities about potential politicization or bias influencing homeland security priorities."
