      "The termination of sanctions may reduce pressure on certain Burundian officials but could risk enabling lingering human rights abuses by those previously targeted, directly affecting citizens-of-specific-countries-by-eo-designation and foreign-government-officials.",
      "Revoking travel restrictions might complicate U.S. efforts to monitor political stability and human rights conditions in Burundi, potentially limiting foreign-service-officers' ability to engage in oversight.",
      "Lifting sanctions may impact international-aid-recipients if donor confidence shifts, possibly leading to fluctuations in aid flows that affect vulnerable populations in Burundi.",
      "Some Burundian individuals previously restricted might exploit the revocation to engage in activities counter to U.S. foreign policy interests, raising concerns about enforcement and ongoing monitoring."
