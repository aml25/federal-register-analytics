      "The establishment of the Emergency Board may delay resolution of labor disputes, prolonging uncertainty for union members and transportation workers, which could impact worker morale and service delivery.",
      "Maintaining existing dispute conditions for 120 days may limit the Long Island Rail Road Company's ability to respond flexibly to operational or economic pressures, negatively affecting large corporation employees involved in management.",
      "Prolonged labor unrest or delays in dispute resolution could disrupt rail services, adversely affecting suburban communities dependent on the Long Island Rail Road for daily commutes.",
      "The neutrality requirement for Emergency Board members might create challenges if parties perceive bias, potentially undermining trust among union members and transportation workers in the dispute resolution process."
