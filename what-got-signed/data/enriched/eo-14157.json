    "potential_concerns": [
      "Designating cartels and transnational criminal organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations may lead to enhanced enforcement actions disproportionately impacting Hispanic / Latino Americans, particularly those in border communities, raising concerns about racial profiling and civil liberties.",
      "The order's provisions for expedited removal under the Alien Enemies Act could unintentionally affect naturalized citizens, asylum seekers, and undocumented immigrants suspected of association, risking wrongful deportations and due process violations.",
      "Increased aggressive law enforcement targeting cartels may improve security for U.S. citizens and crime victims but could also escalate violence and instability in border communities.",
      "The broad designation of cartels as terrorist organizations may complicate asylum and immigration claims by individuals fleeing cartel-related violence, potentially limiting protections for vulnerable populations such as asylum seekers."
