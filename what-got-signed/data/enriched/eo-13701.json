      "Delegating trade-related authorities to the U.S. Trade Representative and other officials may result in insufficient labor protections impacting non-union workers adversely, despite intended worker-rights-protections.",
      "Environmental review processes coordinated under this order might inadequately involve environmental justice communities, leading to overlooked negative environmental impacts in vulnerable areas.",
      "Interagency coordination challenges could delay or weaken effective enforcement of trade agreements, resulting in labor rights and environmental standards not being fully upheld for working-age adults and union members.",
      "The delegation of authority might concentrate trade negotiation power within a few offices, potentially reducing transparency and diminishing opportunities for affected workers and communities to influence trade policy outcomes."
