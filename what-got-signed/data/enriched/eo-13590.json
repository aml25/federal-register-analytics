      "Sanctions imposed under this order may negatively impact U.S. corporations and their employees involved in supplying goods, services, or technology to Iran's energy and petrochemical sectors, potentially resulting in lost business and job reductions.",
      "Restrictions on foreign-government-officials and citizens of Iran could escalate diplomatic tensions and may complicate multilateral negotiations involving Iran, with possible ramifications for broader U.S. foreign policy.",
      "Energy sector workers in the oil and gas industries may face indirect economic effects due to disruptions in global energy markets stemming from sanctions targeting Iran's petroleum and petrochemical development.",
      "The order's broad definition of sanctioned entities and related parties could create compliance challenges for large corporations and financial institutions, increasing legal and operational risks for employees and contractors.",
      "Federal employees and security clearance holders involved in enforcement may face increased workload and complexities related to monitoring and implementing sanctions, potentially affecting operational efficiency."
