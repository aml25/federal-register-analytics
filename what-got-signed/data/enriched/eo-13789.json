    "potential_concerns": [
      "Efforts to reduce tax regulatory burdens might disproportionately benefit small-business-owners and entrepreneurs by simplifying compliance, but could reduce necessary oversight and protections for taxpayers, potentially increasing risks of tax avoidance or errors.",
      "The executive order’s emphasis on deregulation may unintentionally lead to oversimplification that creates loopholes disadvantaging middle-class-americans who rely on clear tax guidance to comply accurately.",
      "Delays or suspensions of existing tax regulations could create short-term uncertainty for taxpayers, especially small-business-owners who depend on stable regulatory environments for financial planning.",
      "Recommendations to rescind or modify tax regulations may fail to address complex tax issues adequately, resulting in increased burdens or confusion for some taxpayers despite the intention to simplify."
