    "summary": "This executive order updates previous tariffs addressing imports from the southern border by changing de minimis duty-free treatment rules. It allows duty-free imports only until the Secretary of Commerce confirms systems are ready to collect tariffs efficiently, aiming to strengthen tariff enforcement and revenue collection related to border trade. The order maintains existing authorities and clarifies no new legal rights are created by it.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Changes to duty-free de minimis treatment may increase costs and administrative burdens for small importers and international shippers reliant on low-value shipments.",
      "Strengthened tariff enforcement could disrupt supply chains and raise prices for U.S. consumers and businesses dependent on goods imported via the southern border.",
      "Uncertainty over when the Secretary of Commerce will determine that tariff collection systems are adequate may create compliance challenges for importers.",
      "Increased focus on tariff revenue collection at the southern border could heighten trade tensions with neighboring countries affected by these duties.",
      "The order lacks a public-facing explanation of how tariff revenue collection improvements will be implemented, potentially delaying its effectiveness."
