    "summary": "This executive order modifies a previous order related to duties (tariffs) imposed to address issues at the U.S. southern border. It allows certain goods to be treated as duty-free under specific conditions until the Secretary of Commerce confirms that tariff collection systems are fully operational. The order clarifies that it does not affect the authority of federal agencies and must be implemented according to law and available funding.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Small business owners and border communities might benefit temporarily from duty-free treatment of certain goods, but uncertainty about the timing of tariff collections could disrupt supply chains and business planning.",
      "Large corporation employees and manufacturing workers could face negative impacts if delays in tariff revenue collection lead to extended tariff exemptions that undermine U.S. producers' competitiveness.",
      "The reliance on the Secretary of Commerce's notification to end duty-free treatment creates ambiguity, potentially causing uneven enforcement and market distortions impacting trade-dependent populations.",
      "The order's limited guidance on funding availability for implementing tariff systems may result in administrative delays, disproportionately affecting border communities reliant on stable trade policies."
