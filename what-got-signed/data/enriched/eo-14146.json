    "potential_concerns": [
      "The partial revocation and realignment may create temporary confusion or gaps in national security protocols affecting active-duty military and intelligence personnel during continuity operations.",
      "Changes to interagency coordination structures could unintentionally slow decision-making or reduce effectiveness in emergency resilience efforts critical to veterans and military personnel.",
      "Revising classification authorities aligned with the National Security Memorandum may raise concerns about information sharing and oversight among intelligence community personnel.",
      "Because the order defers implementation to funding availability, insufficient appropriations could hinder mission resilience capabilities, disproportionately impacting military readiness."
