    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to work together to prepare the nation for space weather events like solar flares and geomagnetic storms, which can disrupt critical infrastructure such as power grids, communications, and transportation. The order establishes agency roles and timelines to improve forecasting, protect infrastructure, and coordinate response efforts to minimize damage and ensure public safety.",

      "Efforts to protect the electrical power grid may impose operational burdens or require infrastructure changes that affect energy-sector-workers-oil-gas-coal, potentially disrupting work schedules and safety protocols.",
      "Transportation-workers might face increased operational challenges during space weather events, especially if forecasting systems generate false alarms or overly cautious warnings, impacting transportation reliability and worker productivity.",
      "Urban-communities and rural-communities could experience uneven levels of preparedness and infrastructure resilience, raising concerns about equitable protection and emergency response capabilities across geographic regions.",
      "Healthcare-workers may confront system interruptions or increased demand during severe space weather events, and shortages in preparedness planning could affect their ability to provide continuous care.",
      "Interagency coordination gaps could delay timely warnings and protection measures, inadvertently exposing critical infrastructure-dependent populations like energy, transportation, healthcare workers and the communities they serve to heightened risks."
