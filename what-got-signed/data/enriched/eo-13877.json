      "Hospitals and healthcare organizations may face increased administrative and compliance costs to meet transparency and reporting requirements, potentially leading to higher overall healthcare prices.",
      "Patients, including Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, may experience confusion or difficulty interpreting complex pricing data despite efforts to create consumer-friendly formats.",
      "Smaller or rural healthcare providers might be disproportionately burdened by transparency mandates, potentially reducing their competitiveness relative to larger hospital systems.",
      "Efforts to increase price transparency could inadvertently exacerbate disparities if vulnerable populations like veterans or Medicaid beneficiaries lack access to digital tools needed to utilize the information effectively."
