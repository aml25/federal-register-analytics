    "potential_concerns": [
      "Consolidating advisory roles in the National Quantum Initiative Advisory Committee may limit the diversity of expert perspectives, potentially impacting scientific researchers and technology workers reliant on broad input for innovation.",
      "The emphasis on national security and economic competitiveness in quantum technology may prioritize certain corporations and sectors over smaller businesses or startups, potentially disadvantaging some stakeholders in the quantum technology ecosystem.",
      "The requirement for security clearances for committee members could restrict participation to those with government ties or security clearances, possibly excluding qualified scientific researchers and technology workers without such access.",
      "U.S. citizens' leadership in quantum technology may inadvertently sideline lawful permanent residents or immigrant scientists in the quantum research community, although they are not explicitly impacted by this order."
