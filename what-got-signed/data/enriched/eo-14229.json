The order directs the Secretary of the Interior to update all official references to reflect this renaming within 30 days.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Renaming the refuge to honor a crime victim may heighten tensions in border and coastal communities by framing immigration primarily through the lens of criminality, potentially stigmatizing undocumented immigrants.",
      "The order’s explicit link between open-border policies and violent crime could lead to increased hostility or discrimination against immigrant populations, especially undocumented immigrants, affecting community cohesion in border areas.",
      "Commemorating one victim in this way risks politicizing public lands management by conflating conservation with immigration enforcement themes, which may detract from the refuge's ecological and recreational functions for all visitors, including local U.S. citizens.",
      "There may be unintended divisiveness within coastal and border communities as some residents may feel the renaming imposes a negative narrative on immigrants, potentially impacting community relations and public perceptions of safety."
