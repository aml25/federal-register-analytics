    "potential_concerns": [
      "Sanctions restricting investment and trade in the DNR and LNR regions may negatively impact U.S.-based corporations and investors with existing or potential economic interests, leading to financial losses and reduced market access.",
      "The travel bans and entry suspensions targeting foreign nationals connected to the Covered Regions could inadvertently affect visa holders and lawful permanent residents with ties to those areas, complicating their immigration or travel status.",
      "Broad blocking of property and prohibitions on transactions may create enforcement challenges and risk of over-compliance by U.S. persons, potentially harming individuals and businesses not intended to be targeted.",
      "U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and other legal residents with personal or familial connections to the Covered Regions could face indirect social and economic hardships as a result of these sanctions and travel restrictions.",
      "The order’s strict prohibitions might unintentionally hinder humanitarian aid or charitable activities in the affected regions, complicating support for vulnerable populations within Ukraine."
