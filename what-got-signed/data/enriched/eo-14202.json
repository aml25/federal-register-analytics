It directs this Task Force to review federal agencies' past actions, recommend corrective measures, and protect the religious freedoms of Americans who practice Christianity.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The establishment of a Task Force focused solely on anti-Christian bias may raise concerns about exclusion or insufficient attention to discrimination faced by other religious groups, potentially impacting broader religious-liberty protections.",
      "Federal agencies might face pressure to overcorrect prior policies, leading to relaxed enforcement against harmful conduct justified as religious expression, which could create tensions with hate-crimes protections.",
      "The Task Force’s review and corrective measures might disproportionately prioritize Christian-affiliated organizations, potentially affecting federal regulatory and funding decisions in ways that could disadvantage secular or non-Christian faith-based communities.",
      "Labeling past law enforcement actions as politically motivated prosecutions risks politicizing federal law enforcement and may undermine public trust, particularly among communities that view certain protests as lawful expressions of free speech.",
      "The order's focus on anti-Christian hostility could lead to increased reporting efforts or enforcement that disproportionately targets individuals and groups accused of anti-Christian conduct, raising concerns about due process and potential overreach."
