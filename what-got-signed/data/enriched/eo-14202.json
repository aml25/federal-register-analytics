      "The order could lead to reduced enforcement of protections against discrimination for non-Christian religious groups or others.",
      "Critics may argue that the focus on anti-Christian bias reflects partisan political motivations rather than objective policy enforcement.",
      "Implementation may challenge federal agencies to fairly distinguish between protecting religious liberty and upholding anti-discrimination laws.",
      "The task force may face difficulties obtaining cooperation from agencies and accurately identifying unlawful practices without bias.",
      "The order may increase tension between religious liberty protections and policies supporting LGBTQ+ rights and other civil rights."
