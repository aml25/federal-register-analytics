    "potential_concerns": [
      "The exclusion of organizations involved in immigration violations may disproportionately restrict loan forgiveness eligibility for undocumented immigrants and DACA recipients working in public service roles.",
      "Restricting PSLF to exclude nonprofit organizations alleged to engage in illegal activities could lead to disputes over which nonprofits qualify, causing uncertainty for students and workers relying on these programs.",
      "The broad definitions of illegal purposes, such as 'aiding and abetting illegal discrimination' or 'violating State tort laws,' might unintentionally disqualify legitimate public service employers, negatively impacting working-age adults and graduate students seeking loan forgiveness.",
      "Limiting PSLF eligibility based on perceived national security concerns may deter qualified individuals from entering public service, especially in roles focused on border security and transnational crime prevention.",
      "The policy's focus on excluding workers affiliated with organizations linked to human trafficking and terrorism could complicate loan forgiveness for employees in complex social service fields where organizational affiliations are not always clear-cut."
