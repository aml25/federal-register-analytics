      "Despite the emphasis on recruitment and retention, agencies might lack the expertise or incentives to fully implement the plans, resulting in minimal improvements for individuals with disabilities seeking federal employment.",
      "Privacy concerns may arise for individuals with disabilities regarding voluntary self-identification and disclosure of disability status during hiring and employment retention processes."
