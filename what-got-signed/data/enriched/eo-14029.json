      "Revoking Executive Orders related to monument protection may create concerns among veterans about the preservation and respect of national memorials and military heritage.",
      "The dismantling of rebranding efforts for U.S. foreign assistance could negatively affect foreign service officers by reducing clarity or support in diplomatic communication and influence-building efforts.",
      "Repealing Schedule F and related excepted service appointments may improve federal workforce meritocracy but could limit agency flexibility and rapid response, affecting civil servants' job security and roles.",
      "The elimination of policies preventing online censorship might create legal and operational uncertainties affecting federal communication standards with indirect repercussions for stakeholders engaged in public information dissemination.",
      "Unwinding regulatory reform efforts aimed at reducing overcriminalization may inadvertently delay progress toward simplifying federal regulations, impacting populations who sought relief through those reforms."
