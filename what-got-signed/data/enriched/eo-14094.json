    "summary": "This executive order updates and improves the federal regulatory review process to make it more effective, inclusive, and transparent. It clarifies what counts as a significant regulation, promotes public participation including from underserved communities, modernizes how public comments and meetings are handled, and requires updated guidance for regulatory analysis that considers equity and distributive impacts.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Efforts to increase public participation and transparency may place new administrative burdens on agencies, potentially slowing regulatory actions that affect underserved and tribal communities.",
      "Modernizing the notice-and-comment process with technological tools could unintentionally disadvantage individuals in low-income or underserved communities who have limited internet access or digital literacy.",
      "Enhanced scrutiny of meeting requests with OIRA to reduce repetitive or duplicative meetings might inadvertently limit access for marginalized groups seeking to engage in the regulatory process.",
      "Revisions to regulatory analysis that consider equity and distributive impacts may lead to contentious debates over measurement methodologies, potentially delaying protections for vulnerable racial and ethnic minorities.",
      "Balancing regulatory reform with inclusion goals risks undermining economic sectors or stakeholders if priorities conflict, possibly affecting low-income families dependent on regulated services."
