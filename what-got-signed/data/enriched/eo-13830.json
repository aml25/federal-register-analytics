      "Delegating broad authority to service Secretaries may lead to inconsistent standards for awarding high-level military decorations, affecting perceptions of fairness among military personnel and veterans.",
      "Noncitizens serving in the armed forces might experience disparities or confusion in award eligibility and recognition due to the complexity of delegation and criteria.",
      "Expanded authority to the Secretary of Homeland Security regarding Coast Guard awards may raise concerns about adequate oversight and uniformity compared to traditional military departments.",
      "Unintended administrative delays or bureaucracy might occur if Secretaries implement differing regulations, potentially impacting timely recognition of heroic acts for active-duty members.",
      "The concentration of award approval authority could lead to politicization or favoritism, undermining morale and force readiness within the military ranks."
