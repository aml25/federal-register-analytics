      "Enhanced intelligence-sharing and interagency coordination could lead to increased surveillance and potential civil rights infringements affecting undocumented immigrants and refugees.",
      "Efforts to disrupt transnational crime networks may inadvertently harm human trafficking victims by complicating victim identification and support processes.",
      "Border communities may face intensified law enforcement presence and operations, potentially impacting local residents and cultural dynamics adversely.",
      "The order’s emphasis on targeting criminal organizations using violence and corruption could risk reinforcing racial and ethnic profiling, disproportionately affecting minority groups including transgender individuals.",
      "Foreign governments cooperating under this order might experience diplomatic strain if U.S. actions are perceived as overreach or interference in their domestic affairs."
