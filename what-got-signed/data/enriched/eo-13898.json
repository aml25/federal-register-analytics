      "The interagency coordination could lead to jurisdictional confusion or delays, potentially hampering timely investigations affecting Native American and Alaska Native women and girls.",
      "Tribal governments might face challenges ensuring their sovereignty and input are fully respected within a federal task force primarily composed of federal agency officials.",
      "Data sharing protocols across federal, state, local, and tribal agencies may raise privacy concerns and mistrust among Native communities regarding the handling of sensitive information.",
      "The task force’s limited two-year term could impede sustained progress on addressing the complex issue of missing and murdered Indigenous persons in tribal communities.",
      "Outreach and education campaigns might inadequately address rural and urban differences in tribal communities, reducing effectiveness in diverse Native populations."
