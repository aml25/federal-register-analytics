      "The expanded role and membership changes to the National Infrastructure Advisory Council could raise concerns about adequate representation and influence of tribal governments in critical infrastructure decisions.",
      "Including private sector corporate executives with security clearances may create conflicts of interest between public security goals and business priorities.",
      "Small business owners involved in critical infrastructure sectors might face increased pressure or scrutiny as private-public partnerships in security intensify under the advisory committee's guidance.",
      "The coordination required among multiple federal advisory committees might lead to overlap and inefficiencies, potentially diluting the effectiveness of advice benefiting corporate executives and security clearance holders."
