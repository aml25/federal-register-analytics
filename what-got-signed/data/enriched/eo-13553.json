      "The blocking of property and visa restrictions on Iranian government officials and associated persons may exacerbate diplomatic tensions, affecting foreign governments and citizens-of-specific-countries-by-eo-designation.",
      "Sanctions may unintentionally restrict lawful permanent residents and visa holders from Iran in the U.S., complicating their ability to access funds or resources tied to blocked persons.",
      "The broad prohibition on dealings with blocked persons could unintentionally impact foreign nationals connected to those individuals, potentially disrupting international business or humanitarian activities.",
      "Visa restrictions targeting individuals involved in human rights abuses may lead to challenges in verifying involvement, raising concerns about due process and potential wrongful inclusion of visa holders or foreign nationals."
