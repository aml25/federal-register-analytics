    "potential_concerns": [
      "The order may limit flexibility by tying succession to specific positions that may not always have individuals eligible or available to serve.",
      "Excluding acting officials from the succession list could create temporary leadership gaps in emergency situations.",
      "Presidential discretion to depart from the order could lead to political disputes or favoritism in acting appointments.",
      "Potential confusion or delay could arise if multiple officials simultaneously claim eligibility to act as Administrator."
