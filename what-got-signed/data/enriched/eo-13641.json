      "Maintaining pay rates at 2010 levels through 2013 could lead to decreased morale and financial hardship among federal employees, including veterans and military personnel, affecting workforce retention and readiness.",
      "Restrictions on pay raises for uniformed services might impair military personnel recruitment and retention, thereby impacting military readiness and force structure.",
      "The revocation of the previous executive order could cause confusion or administrative delays in pay adjustments for senior executives and judges, leading to pay inconsistencies.",
      "Locality-based comparability payments maintained at or below prior levels may not adequately address rising living costs in high-cost areas, disproportionately affecting foreign service officers and other geographically-dispersed federal employees."
