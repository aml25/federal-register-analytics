    "potential_concerns": [
      "The advisory board's recommendations might prioritize policies favoring larger economic sectors, potentially overlooking small business needs and union members during recovery efforts.",
      "There is a risk that the board's advice could lead to financial regulations that inadvertently slow job growth, negatively impacting working-age adults and middle-class Americans.",
      "The board’s diverse membership from the private sector may present conflicts of interest that could bias economic recovery advice against broader public interests.",
      "Since the PERAB is advisory only and temporary, its effectiveness in producing meaningful change for the targeted populations may be limited, delaying critical economic recovery benefits."
