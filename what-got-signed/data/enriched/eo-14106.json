    "potential_concerns": [
      "Delegating presidential appointment and promotion authority to the Secretary of Homeland Security may raise concerns about maintaining military-readiness and proper checks on Coast Guard officer management, affecting active-duty personnel.",
      "During war or national emergencies, broad authority to suspend certain laws and promote officers without presidential approval could lead to inconsistent or politicized personnel decisions impacting military-personnel-active-duty and reserves.",
      "The shift in authority when the Coast Guard operates as part of the Navy transfers decision-making to the Secretary of Defense, which could create coordination challenges or delays affecting Coast Guard officers’ career progression.",
      "Non-transparent decision-making processes under delegated authority may reduce oversight and perceived fairness in promotions and separations, potentially undermining morale among active-duty Coast Guard members."
