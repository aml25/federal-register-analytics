    "potential_concerns": [
      "Expanding the National Economic Council to include diverse agencies may slow decision-making, potentially delaying support for small-business-owners during economic crises.",
      "Greater emphasis on energy and climate change within economic policy could shift resources away from fossil fuel sectors, negatively impacting some energy-sector-workers (oil, gas, coal) not directly represented in the council.",
      "Enhanced interagency coordination might result in policy complexity that teachers-educators must navigate when federal education initiatives align with economic goals, causing implementation challenges.",
      "Renewable-energy-workers may benefit from increased advocacy, but unintended neglect of traditional energy-worker transition plans could cause workforce displacement without adequate support."
