      "Coordinating multiple agencies and offices risks bureaucratic delays or overlapping responsibilities that could hamper effective implementation.",
      "Measuring progress through agency plans could be hindered if clear and standardized metrics are not established and enforced.",
      "Some stakeholders may argue that the order does not sufficiently address deep structural inequities or broader systemic racism beyond federal programs.",
      "There may be challenges in balancing the diverse needs of over 100 distinct HBCUs with varying sizes, locations, and academic focuses."
