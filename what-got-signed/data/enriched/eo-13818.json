      "The broad designation of individuals involved in serious human rights abuses or corruption may lead to misidentification or overreach, negatively affecting innocent foreign nationals and officials who rely on U.S. entry or financial access (travel-restrictions-bans, economic-sanctions).",
      "Restrictions on international aid recipients suspected of ties to corrupt or abusive entities could hinder humanitarian efforts and harm vulnerable populations dependent on U.S. foreign aid (foreign-aid, human-rights-international).",
      "The use of economic sanctions may unintentionally destabilize foreign economies or political systems, potentially exacerbating regional conflicts or humanitarian crises for general foreign populations (economic-sanctions, national-emergencies).",
      "Blocking assets and prohibiting transactions could create challenges for legitimate businesses and institutions indirectly linked to designated individuals, affecting economic activities and international cooperation (economic-sanctions, corporations-businesses)."
