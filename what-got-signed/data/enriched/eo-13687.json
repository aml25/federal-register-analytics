      "Restrictions on U.S. persons conducting transactions with blocked North Korean entities could unintentionally ensnare multinational corporations and complicate lawful business activities.",
      "Cybersecurity-related sanctions may escalate retaliatory cyberattacks against U.S. interests, affecting sectors like technology-workers and cybersecurity-professionals.",
      "Visa restrictions may impact legitimate North Korean students and researchers seeking education in the U.S., affecting international-students specifically."
