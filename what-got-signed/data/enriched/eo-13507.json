      "The creation of a centralized Health Reform Office could inadvertently create bureaucratic hurdles that impede timely policy implementation affecting vulnerable populations.",
      "Public outreach and policy integration efforts might fail to adequately engage underserved communities, limiting the effectiveness of reforms aimed at expanding coverage and improving quality."
