    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to prioritize the purchase and use of American-made iron, steel, aluminum, cement, and other manufactured products in infrastructure projects funded with federal financial assistance. It aims to strengthen the Buy-American preference in federally funded infrastructure to support domestic manufacturing and jobs.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The reinforcement of Buy-American preferences could benefit manufacturing and construction workers by supporting domestic jobs but may disadvantage small business owners who rely on more cost-competitive foreign materials, raising concerns about increased project costs and reduced competitiveness.",
      "The focus on strictly American-made materials may delay infrastructure project timelines if compliant products are not readily available, negatively impacting construction workers and project beneficiaries in urban and rural communities.",
      "Union members could see strengthened job security and wage benefits; however, the order might inadvertently pressure agencies to prioritize larger manufacturers over smaller, potentially non-union suppliers, exacerbating economic disparities among small businesses.",
      "Stricter domestic sourcing requirements could increase infrastructure spending and complicate permitting processes, possibly limiting innovation or adoption of more sustainable materials, affecting long-term infrastructure quality and costs."
