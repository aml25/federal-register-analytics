    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to promote the development and use of small modular nuclear reactors, particularly micro-reactors, to enhance energy security for national defense and support space exploration missions. It establishes timelines for demonstrating these technologies at military installations and for NASA to define nuclear energy requirements for space missions through 2040, while coordinating fuel supply and technology roadmaps across agencies.",

      "Reliance on a still-developing domestic supply chain for advanced nuclear fuels like HALEU could cause bottlenecks or delays in reactor deployment.",
      "The coordination required across multiple federal agencies may complicate implementation and lead to bureaucratic delays.",
      "Remote operation and deployment of small modular reactors in space raise technical and safety challenges that could affect mission success.",
      "There may be concerns about nuclear proliferation and cybersecurity risks associated with the expanded use of nuclear reactors in defense and space contexts."
