    "summary": "This executive order excludes certain federal agencies and their subdivisions that handle intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work from federal labor-management relations programs to protect national security. It also delegates authority to specific department secretaries to suspend or exclude subdivisions from collective bargaining coverage when necessary for security or operational flexibility.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Excluding intelligence community personnel and foreign service officers from labor-management relations may diminish their collective bargaining rights and reduce protections related to working conditions.",
      "The delegation of authority to the Secretaries of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Transportation to exclude or suspend labor relations could lead to inconsistent application of worker protections and potential misuse of discretion in suspending collective bargaining rights.",
      "Transportation workers, especially those in agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration, may face reduced ability to negotiate work conditions, impacting workforce stability and operational safety.",
      "Terminating grievance and arbitration proceedings for excluded employees might lead to unresolved workplace disputes, negatively affecting morale and potentially compromising operational effectiveness in national security roles.",
      "The restriction on collective bargaining in agencies critical to homeland security and intelligence operations may have the unintended consequence of reducing transparency and employee voice, potentially impacting employee retention and recruitment."
