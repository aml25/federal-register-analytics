      "The increased deployment of federal law enforcement to escort Postal Workers may cause jurisdictional conflicts and strain relations with State and Local Law Enforcement Officers.",
      "Relying on the U.S. Postal Service for rapid medical countermeasure delivery could place Postal Workers at increased risk, with concerns about their safety and operational capacity during a biological attack.",
      "The plan to maintain continuity of essential federal government functions might prioritize Federal Employees, potentially limiting timely access to medical countermeasures for the general U.S. citizen population.",
      "The coordination required across multiple federal and local agencies may result in logistical delays, reducing the effectiveness of rapid response intended to mitigate morbidity and mortality among U.S. citizens."
