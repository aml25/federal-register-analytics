      "The prohibitions on new investments and services to Russia directly burden U.S. corporations and investors with existing or planned economic interests, potentially reducing profitability and international business opportunities.",
      "Employees of large corporations engaged in commerce or investment with Russia may face job insecurity or layoffs due to restricted business activities caused by these sanctions.",
      "Foreign nationals associated with affected Russian entities could experience indirect negative effects due to limitations on U.S.-origin services and investments, complicating international business relationships.",
      "The order’s broad prohibitions and secondary sanctions on facilitation may create legal and compliance uncertainties for multinational companies and their employees, leading to inadvertent violations and penalties."
