    "potential_concerns": [
      "The reform may unintentionally favor Tribal Nations with greater administrative capacity, potentially widening disparities among smaller or resource-limited tribal communities.",
      "Efforts to streamline application and reporting processes could risk insufficient oversight, possibly reducing accountability in the use of federal funds intended for tribal self-determination.",
      "Interagency coordination mandates may be challenging to implement effectively, causing delays or discrepancies in funding benefits reaching tribal populations, especially impacting tribal governments and communities.",
      "Expanding flexibility in funding use, including administrative costs, may raise concerns among stakeholders about the appropriate allocation of federal resources intended for direct community services and development.",
      "Changes to consultation and reporting processes involving tribal colleges may require careful balancing to respect tribal sovereignty while ensuring compliance with civil-rights-enforcement requirements."
