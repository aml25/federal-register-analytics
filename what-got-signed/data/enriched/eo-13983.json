      "Removing these ethics commitments could reduce public trust in the ethical standards of executive branch appointees.",
      "Without these restrictions, there may be a greater risk of conflicts of interest or ethical lapses among federal employees.",
      "The revocation might create uncertainty for employees regarding their ethical obligations during the transition period.",
      "Critics may view this action as weakening government accountability and transparency.",
      "Implementing the revocation uniformly across all agencies could present coordination challenges."
