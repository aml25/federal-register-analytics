      "Adjusting pay rates for federal employees and uniformed services may create budgetary pressures that could lead to future pay freezes or cuts impacting morale and retention within these groups.",
      "The updated locality-based comparability payments might disproportionately benefit federal employees in high-cost urban areas while leaving those in less expensive or rural areas with comparatively stagnant wages, potentially affecting workforce distribution.",
      "Changes to Veterans Health Administration pay schedules could unintentionally affect recruitment and retention of healthcare professionals within the VA system, impacting veterans' access to quality healthcare.",
      "Implementation complexities across multiple pay systems, including statutory and administrative law judges, might cause delays or errors in salary adjustments, negatively impacting the affected populations' financial planning."
