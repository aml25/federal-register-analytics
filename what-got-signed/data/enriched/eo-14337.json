      "Revocation of the prior competition-focused order could reduce regulatory pressure on large corporations and their executives, potentially enabling anti-competitive practices.",
      "Small business owners might face increased challenges due to less federal emphasis on promoting competition, limiting their market opportunities.",
      "Consumers and small businesses could experience negative effects indirectly through reduced market competition, despite not being directly tagged, as market dynamics shift.",
      "The order's clarity that it does not alter existing laws might create ambiguity about how strictly competition policies will be enforced, potentially disadvantaging smaller market players."
