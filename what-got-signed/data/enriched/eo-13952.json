    "summary": "This executive order directs the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure hospitals and federally funded programs provide necessary medical screening, treatment, and protections for all newborn and infant children, including those born prematurely or with disabilities. It emphasizes the legal rights of infants to receive lifesaving care and prohibits discrimination based on disability, while also promoting research and training related to infant care.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The order's strict anti-discrimination requirements may increase operational and financial pressures on hospitals when providing complex care to extremely premature or disabled infants, potentially impacting healthcare markets and resource allocation.",
      "Mandating lifesaving treatment without regard to prognosis could raise ethical and medical disagreements among healthcare workers and parents, especially concerning quality-of-life considerations for infants born extremely prematurely or with severe disabilities.",
      "Enforcement actions such as termination of federal funding could disproportionately affect some hospitals, especially smaller or rural healthcare organizations, possibly limiting access to neonatal care in underserved communities.",
      "The order might result in increased litigation or complaints against hospitals by parents, thereby creating administrative burdens for healthcare organizations and HHS.",
      "The emphasis on ensuring treatment regardless of disability status may challenge established medical protocols and raise concerns among providers regarding medical judgment and standard of care for newborns with severe impairments."
