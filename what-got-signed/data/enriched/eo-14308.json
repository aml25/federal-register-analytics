    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to improve wildfire prevention and response by streamlining wildfire programs, encouraging local wildfire preparedness, updating technology for firefighting, and revising rules that hinder effective wildfire mitigation.

      "Streamlining federal wildfire programs and changing regulations could reduce oversight and environmental protections, potentially harming rural and tribal communities reliant on forest health.",
      "Efforts to expedite wildfire response and modify rules on prescribed burns might expose local communities, including tribal populations, to increased smoke and health risks if not carefully managed.",
      "Prioritizing sale of excess military aircraft for wildfire response may strain military resources or personnel assigned to wildfire missions, impacting active-duty military personnel.",
      "Changes to utility regulations and litigation positions could shift wildfire liability burdens onto local governments or communities, negatively influencing rural and tribal populations.",
      "Incentivizing state and local wildfire mitigation practices without equitable funding could disadvantage smaller or under-resourced local governments, widening regional inequalities in wildfire preparedness."
