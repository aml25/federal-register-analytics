    "potential_concerns": [
      "Efforts to improve policing practices might face resistance from some law enforcement officers who perceive reforms as constraints on their authority or operational flexibility.",
      "While aiming to build trust, recommendations could inadvertently overlook nuanced needs of diverse racial/ethnic groups such as African Americans and Hispanic/Latino Americans, potentially limiting effectiveness in urban communities disproportionately affected by policing.",
      "The advisory nature of the Task Force risks producing recommendations without enforcement power, which may frustrate crime victims and communities seeking tangible accountability and rapid changes in policing.",
      "There is a potential that the Task Force’s public meetings and engagements could heighten tensions or distrust if certain communities or stakeholders feel underrepresented or unheard in the process."
