    "potential_concerns": [
      "The codified order of succession may limit the President's flexibility to appoint acting Directors outside the predefined hierarchy, potentially constraining responsiveness during crises or transitions affecting political appointees.",
      "Officials next in line for acting Director roles might face increased pressure or politicization, impacting office stability and potentially affecting government efficiency.",
      "Ambiguities in eligibility under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act could cause confusion or legal challenges for acting officials within the succession order, complicating continuity of operations.",
      "Excluding individuals in acting roles from succession may reduce the pool of available qualified candidates, possibly delaying leadership transitions in the Office of Management and Budget."
