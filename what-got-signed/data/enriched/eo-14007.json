      "The council’s advice might overlap or conflict with other existing science and technology advisory bodies, causing coordination challenges.",
      "Without ensured funding beyond existing appropriations, the PCAST may face resource constraints affecting its effectiveness.",
      "The termination date without automatic renewal may lead to discontinuity in long-term advisory efforts."
