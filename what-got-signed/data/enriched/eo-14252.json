      "The intensification of federal immigration enforcement and coordination to apprehend and deport illegal aliens may lead to increased targeting and displacement of undocumented immigrants, raising humanitarian and civil rights concerns.",
      "The directive to promptly remove homeless or vagrant encampments on federal lands could result in displacement of homeless individuals without adequate provision of alternative housing or services, exacerbating their vulnerability.",
      "Coordination to increase law enforcement presence and strict enforcement of nuisance and quality of life laws might lead to over-policing in urban communities and potential criminalization of minor offenses, disproportionately affecting marginalized populations.",
      "Efforts to collaborate on speeding and lowering costs of concealed carry licensing may generate tensions between public safety goals and gun owners’ rights, impacting the balance of crime reduction and Second Amendment advocacy."
