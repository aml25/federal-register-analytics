    "summary": "This executive order directs the Department of Education to reform the higher education accreditation system to ensure colleges provide high-quality education without unlawful discrimination.

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The removal of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) requirements may undermine protections and support for racial and ethnic minority students, women, and LGBTQ+ individuals, potentially increasing discriminatory practices on campuses.",
      "Focusing accreditation solely on measurable student outcomes and market returns could disadvantage institutions serving historically marginalized populations, harming college-university-students from underrepresented groups and widening educational inequities.",
      "Efforts to expand accreditation options and reduce ‘unnecessary costs’ might lead to less rigorous standards, risking a decrease in overall education quality for students and weakening institutional accountability.",
      "The prohibition of accreditors from enforcing DEI standards could limit campus free speech protections and academic freedom for marginalized populations by reducing institutional commitments to inclusive educational environments."
