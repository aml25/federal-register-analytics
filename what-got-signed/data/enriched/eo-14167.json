      "The increased militarization of border security pursuant to this order may lead to harsher enforcement measures negatively impacting asylum-seekers' ability to safely seek protection.",
      "Prioritizing USNORTHCOM with mission to seal borders could strain military resources, reducing readiness for other national defense priorities and affecting active-duty military personnel.",
      "Border communities might experience disruptions to daily life and economic activity due to heightened military presence and operations focused on curbing mass migration and drug trafficking.",
      "Heightened enforcement efforts targeting transnational criminal organizations may inadvertently result in racial profiling and civil rights violations against Hispanic / Latino Americans and undocumented immigrants."
