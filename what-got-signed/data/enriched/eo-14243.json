    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to remove barriers that prevent sharing unclassified data across government departments, aiming to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse. It requires agency heads to provide full access to relevant data and to review and modify regulations and policies that restrict information sharing, improving government efficiency and oversight.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Enhanced interagency data sharing may improve fraud detection in federal and state assistance programs, positively impacting low-income individuals and Medicaid beneficiaries but raising privacy concerns.",
      "Removing barriers to data access could increase the risk of unauthorized exposure or misuse of sensitive personal information affecting uninsured individuals and those experiencing poverty.",
      "Mandating prompt data access from state programs receiving federal funds may strain state agencies' resources and lead to inconsistent data sharing practices, potentially disrupting service delivery to vulnerable populations.",
      "Efforts to eliminate regulatory barriers might inadvertently weaken protections on unclassified but sensitive data, possibly compromising the privacy rights of populations reliant on government assistance.",
      "Unfettered access to unemployment data by the Department of Labor, while intended to reduce waste and fraud, could lead to intrusive monitoring practices that impact privacy for unemployed individuals seeking benefits."
