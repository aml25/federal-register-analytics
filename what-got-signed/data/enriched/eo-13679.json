    "potential_concerns": [
      "The imposed maintenance of status quo conditions during the dispute might prolong unresolved labor tensions, adversely affecting transportation-workers reliant on timely contract settlements.",
      "If the Emergency Board's recommended settlement is accepted without full consensus, union-members may feel their bargaining power is undermined, potentially fostering unrest or decreased morale.",
      "Potential delays in resolving the dispute could disrupt Southeastern Pennsylvania transportation services, indirectly impacting commuting working-age-adults in urban-communities who depend on SEPTA.",
      "There is a risk that the reliance on an emergency board could set a precedent for federal intervention in local labor disputes, raising concerns among union-members about future autonomy in negotiations."
