      "The effectiveness of financial capability programs may vary across underserved populations such as women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and tribal communities due to differences in resource access and culturally relevant content.",
      "Youth and students from low-income families might face challenges in accessing or fully benefiting from financial education if public-private partnership efforts do not adequately address disparities in school and community resources.",
      "Reliance on voluntary council members and private sector partnerships could lead to uneven prioritization of financial literacy initiatives, potentially neglecting the needs of marginalized young adults.",
      "Measuring outcomes and success of financial capability programs among diverse youth populations might be difficult due to variability in data collection methods and financial behavior assessments."
