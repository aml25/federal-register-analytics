      "Efforts to cut bureaucratic delays may weaken environmental protections, potentially adversely impacting tribal communities and rural residents reliant on ecosystem health (themes: environmental-regulation, public-lands-management).",
      "Expanded access to public lands for activities such as hunting and off-roading could increase environmental degradation and conflict with conservation goals, affecting future outdoor recreation opportunities (themes: public-lands-management).",
      "The emphasis on voluntary, collaborative conservation rather than regulation risks insufficient action to recover fish and wildlife populations, which could harm ecosystems important to indigenous peoples and outdoor recreation users (themes: federal-advisory-committees, interagency-coordination).",
      "Interagency coordination challenges might delay needed infrastructure maintenance or improvements, prolonging access difficulties for rural communities and outdoor recreation users (themes: interagency-coordination)."
