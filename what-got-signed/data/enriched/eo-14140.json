      "Sanctions targeting foreign government officials and affiliated businesses may exacerbate economic instability and inadvertently harm civilians in Western Balkans countries, including international aid recipients reliant on foreign assistance.",
      "Efforts to block property and financial interests risk pushing corrupt actors to rely on covert methods, complicating enforcement and potentially impacting lawful foreign businesses and investors operating in the region.",
      "The inclusion of family members such as spouses and adult children in sanctions could raise human rights and due process concerns affecting innocent individuals closely tied to targeted persons.",
      "Heightened sanctions might worsen diplomatic relations with Western Balkan nations and complicate ongoing peace and cooperation agreements, potentially undermining long-term regional stability."
