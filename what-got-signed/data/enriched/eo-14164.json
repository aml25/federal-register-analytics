    "summary": "This executive order directs the federal government to restore the use of the death penalty for serious federal crimes, actively pursue capital punishment for certain offenses, and support states in maintaining their death penalty systems. It also prioritizes public safety by encouraging prosecution of violent crimes and dismantling transnational criminal activity, reversing recent federal actions that limited capital punishment enforcement.",

      "The increased pursuit and application of the death penalty may disproportionately affect incarcerated individuals, especially those convicted of capital crimes, raising concerns of fairness and potential wrongful executions.",
      "The explicit targeting of capital crimes committed by aliens illegally present in the country may lead to intensified prosecutions and harsher penalties for undocumented immigrants, potentially increasing fear and reducing cooperation with law enforcement in immigrant communities.",
      "Efforts to dismantle transnational criminal activity and prioritize violent crime prosecution could increase pressure on federal and state law enforcement, possibly resulting in escalated policing tactics that impact urban and border communities disproportionately.",
      "Supporting states in maintaining the death penalty and ensuring drug supplies for lethal injections may reignite contentious debates around capital punishment, affecting crime victims and their families differently depending on their stance toward justice and closure."
