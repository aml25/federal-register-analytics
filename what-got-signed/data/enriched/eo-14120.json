    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to prioritize and enhance research on women's health, addressing long-standing gaps particularly affecting women of color, older women, and women with disabilities. It establishes interagency coordination, funding priorities, and promotes innovation to improve knowledge, clinical trials, and treatment for conditions that uniquely or disproportionately impact women.",

      "Increased focus on women's health research may reduce funding and attention for other medical research areas, creating competition for limited resources.",
      "New reporting and data requirements could increase administrative burdens on researchers and grant recipients, potentially slowing research progress.",
      "Efforts to increase inclusion and recruitment of women in clinical trials may face practical challenges and resistance in certain scientific fields or agencies.",
      "The emphasis on interagency coordination might lead to bureaucratic delays or conflicts over authority among federal departments.",
      "Risks exist that prioritizing innovation through specific agencies and small businesses could favor established players, limiting broader research diversity."
