      "The updated structure and responsibilities of advisory committees related to cybersecurity-national-security may increase demands on cybersecurity professionals without providing adequate support or resources.",
      "Environmental justice communities might experience delays in policy advocacy or diminished direct influence if committee roles are not sufficiently inclusive or responsive to their needs.",
      "Individuals with disabilities and those with mental health conditions could be underrepresented in advisory committees, limiting the effectiveness of related public-health-emergency-response policies.",
      "Delegation of oversight to department heads may reduce transparency and public accountability, potentially marginalizing the voices of vulnerable populations represented by these advisory committees."
