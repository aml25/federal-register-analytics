    "potential_concerns": [
      "The use of broad economic sanctions on foreign persons and entities may complicate diplomatic relations and potentially harm legitimate foreign businesses engaged in lawful trade, impacting corporations-businesses.",
      "Restrictions on entry to the United States for certain foreign nationals identified as connected to the illicit drug trade may raise concerns about due process and the potential for erroneous designation affecting innocent individuals.",
      "Enhanced sanctions targeting drug trafficking networks may improve outcomes for crime victims and border communities by reducing drug flow but could also lead to temporary disruptions in local economies dependent on cross-border activities.",
      "Law enforcement agencies may face challenges in effectively identifying and designating sanctioned persons without clear intelligence, possibly resulting in enforcement inefficiencies or overreach affecting foreign nationals.",
      "Collateral damage to non-targeted foreign nationals and entities, due to broad definitions in the order, might create unintended barriers to international cooperation crucial for combating drug trafficking globally."
