      "Increased support for union organizing may raise compliance and operational costs for small-business-owners, potentially limiting their growth or employment capacity.",
      "Efforts to promote unionization in traditionally non-union sectors could create friction between non-union-workers seeking to organize and corporate-executives-officers resisting changes to labor-management relations.",
      "Targeted encouragement of unionization among marginalized groups, including women and african-americans-black-americans, may face legal and social challenges in workplaces and industries with entrenched resistance to collective bargaining.",
      "The focus on expanding union density could unintentionally marginalize gig-economy-workers and independent contractors who do not fit existing labor frameworks, potentially leaving them without protections.",
      "Revocation of previous workforce councils might disrupt ongoing initiatives beneficial to certain worker segments, creating transitional uncertainty for working-age-adults in affected industries."
