    "potential_concerns": [
      "Efforts to expand no-cost contraception coverage under the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid may face pushback from states with restrictive reproductive health laws, potentially limiting impact for Medicaid beneficiaries in those states.",
      "Providers and healthcare workers may face increased operational burdens or liability concerns while implementing enhanced privacy protections for reproductive health information.",
      "Low-income individuals and Medicaid beneficiaries might still experience access barriers if federal guidance is unevenly applied or insufficiently funded, especially in rural or underserved areas.",
      "Veterans and active duty military personnel could encounter disparities in contraception availability if military health systems and VA programs do not fully adopt or implement new coverage and awareness initiatives.",
      "Public awareness campaigns aimed at educating ACA enrollees and federal beneficiaries about contraception access risks politicization or misinformation that could undermine utilization among target populations."
