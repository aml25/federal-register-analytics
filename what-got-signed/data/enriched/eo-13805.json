    "potential_concerns": [
      "Streamlining infrastructure approval processes may prioritize large corporations and undermine local governments and tribal governments' control, potentially impacting small-business-owners and communities dependent on local infrastructure decisions.",
      "Increasing public-private partnerships could advantage large private investors and technology companies, potentially sidelining union-members and construction-workers by promoting non-union labor or reducing labor protections.",
      "Emphasis on funding renewable energy infrastructure might benefit renewable-energy-workers but could inadvertently cause economic hardships for traditional energy-sector workers not directly supported by this Council.",
      "Accelerated infrastructure projects in urban and rural communities risk insufficient environmental review, adversely affecting environmental quality and the quality of life for residents in those areas.",
      "Technological innovation promotion may widen disparities between urban-communities with access to broadband and technology infrastructure and underserved rural-communities, exacerbating the digital divide."
