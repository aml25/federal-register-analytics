      "The accelerated acquisition and risk-tolerant approach may pressure defense-industry-workers and federal-contractors to meet faster deadlines potentially compromising work quality or worker safety (themes: defense-industrial-base, workforce-development).",
      "Reforming and potentially downsizing or reorganizing the acquisition workforce might lead to job insecurity or layoffs among federal-contractors and defense-industry-workers receiving contracts (themes: government-efficiency, workforce-development).",
      "The review and possible cancellation of major defense acquisition programs could disrupt current military procurement plans, adversely impacting active duty military personnel's access to needed advanced capabilities (themes: military-readiness-force-structure).",
      "Prioritizing commercial solutions and innovative contracting authorities might favor larger corporations, risking adverse effects on smaller defense contractors and their workers (themes: defense-industrial-base, government-efficiency).",
      "Rapid acquisition reforms could inadvertently increase risks of oversight lapses or poor contract management, which could reduce long-term program effectiveness and thus impact veterans and military personnel relying on sustained capabilities (themes: government-efficiency, military-readiness-force-structure)."
