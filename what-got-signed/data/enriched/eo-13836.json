    "summary": "This executive order aims to make federal union collective bargaining more efficient, effective, and cost-saving. It establishes a working group to share best practices, encourages timely negotiations, and requires agencies to report and publicly share collective bargaining agreements to improve government operations.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The order’s emphasis on reducing negotiation times and limiting bargaining scope may negatively impact federal employees’ ability to secure favorable working conditions, harming morale and job satisfaction.",
      "Labor unions may face weakened collective bargaining power due to restrictions on subjects considered negotiable and accelerated negotiation timelines, potentially undermining employee representation.",
      "Efforts to increase agency operational flexibility and hold employees more accountable could lead to increased management discretion that might sideline employee protections and due process.",
      "Taxpayers may experience cost savings in the short term, but overly rigid bargaining processes could degrade workforce performance and service quality, ultimately affecting government efficiency and public trust.",
      "The establishment of a central Labor Relations Group and information sharing may reduce negotiation duplication but could also lead to one-size-fits-all approaches that do not reflect unique agency or workforce needs."
