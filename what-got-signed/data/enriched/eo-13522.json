    "potential_concerns": [
      "Implementation of labor-management forums may raise concerns among federal employees and labor unions about the true extent of their influence if management predominates decision-making, potentially undermining worker-rights-protections.",
      "Efforts to improve government efficiency via pre-decisional involvement could unintentionally slow down decision-making or create bureaucratic delays affecting service delivery to the public.",
      "Pilot programs allowing collective bargaining over permissive subjects might lead to inconsistent application across agencies, causing confusion or perceived unfairness among federal employees and their unions.",
      "There is a risk that without clear metrics and enforcement, labor-management forums may become symbolic, failing to produce meaningful workplace improvements for federal employees.",
      "Union representatives might be concerned about management sharing insufficient or selective information, limiting genuine collaboration and potentially harming labor relations."
