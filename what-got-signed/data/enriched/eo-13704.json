      "The selective recruitment of high-profile entrepreneurs and innovators may create barriers for diverse candidates within the technology sector, potentially limiting opportunities for underrepresented technology workers.",
      "Short-term, time-limited appointments could result in continuity challenges within federal projects, impacting the long-term effectiveness of government IT modernization efforts.",
      "Placement of Fellows in federal agencies might cause friction or duplication of efforts with existing agency staff, complicating interagency coordination and workforce management.",
      "Reliance on Fellows for major innovation initiatives could inadvertently deprioritize internal employee development and technological capacity-building within federal agencies."
