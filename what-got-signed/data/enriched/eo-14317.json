    "summary": "This executive order establishes a new category called Schedule G in the federal excepted service for noncareer positions that are policy-making or policy-advocating and typically change with a new President. It clarifies which positions fall under this new schedule, updates civil service rules accordingly, and sets guidelines for appointments, especially within the Department of Veterans Affairs.",

      "The creation of Schedule G could increase political volatility for noncareer policy-making positions, heightening job insecurity among political appointees.",
      "The specific exclusion of political affiliation in Veterans Affairs Schedule G appointments may cause implementation challenges and delays, potentially impacting veterans' policy continuity and care.",
      "Ambiguities in defining which positions fit Schedule G may lead to inconsistent classifications affecting both veterans' service delivery and political appointee career stability.",
      "The expansion of noncareer policy-making roles subject to Presidential transitions might reduce institutional knowledge retention within the Department of Veterans Affairs, indirectly impacting veteran healthcare outcomes."
