    "potential_concerns": [
      "Extending the suspension of tariffs may reduce immediate pressure on China to fully address trade imbalances and non-reciprocal practices.",
      "The tariff continuation could harm U.S. manufacturing workers by sustaining competition from lower-cost imports.",
      "Implementation requires coordination among numerous federal agencies, risking delays or inconsistent enforcement.",
      "Suspension of tariffs may reduce U.S. leverage in ongoing trade negotiations with China, potentially weakening long-term outcomes."
