    "potential_concerns": [
      "The continued suspension of higher tariffs on Chinese imports may pressure domestic manufacturing workers who compete with lower-cost imports, potentially limiting job growth in this sector.",
      "Small business owners who rely on imports from China may benefit from lower costs, but retail workers could face job insecurity if tariff adjustments lead to shifts in supply chains or pricing strategies.",
      "Consumers might experience short-term price relief due to tariff suspensions, but ongoing national security concerns and trade tensions could lead to future tariff volatility, affecting market stability.",
      "The executive order's reliance on a national emergency declaration for trade policy raises concerns about the potential for prolonged use of emergency powers in economic regulation, impacting business planning and investment decisions."
