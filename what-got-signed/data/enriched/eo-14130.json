    "potential_concerns": [
      "The regulation mandating randomized selection of court-martial members may improve fairness but could face resistance from military leadership concerned about the impact on traditional court-martial panel compositions, affecting military-personnel-active-duty.",
      "Amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial could create confusion or delays in ongoing cases if not clearly implemented, negatively impacting defendants-accused-persons who might face uncertainty in their legal proceedings.",
      "Changes intended to enhance criminal-justice reform within the military justice system may unintentionally strain military readiness if extended court-martial processes reduce operational focus or availability of personnel (military-personnel-active-duty).",
      "Veterans observing amendments reflecting fairness improvements might view the changes positively, but any perceived inconsistency in legal standards' retroactive application could raise concerns about justice and fairness."
