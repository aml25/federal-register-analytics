    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to strengthen and revitalize America's nuclear energy industry by improving domestic nuclear fuel production, supporting advanced nuclear reactor development, expanding the nuclear workforce, and ensuring secure nuclear supply chains. It aims to increase nuclear power capacity, reduce reliance on foreign sources, and enhance national and economic security through coordinated government efforts and industry partnerships.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Efforts to expand nuclear fuel production and advanced reactor deployment may raise environmental and health risks for environmental-justice-communities located near affected sites, disproportionately impacting rural-communities where many nuclear facilities are sited.",
      "Workforce development initiatives are focused on expanding nuclear-related education and jobs, but may not adequately address inclusivity or the retraining needs of displaced workers from declining energy sectors, affecting working-age adults broadly.",
      "Increased domestic uranium enrichment and fuel cycle activities might face regulatory, safety, and local opposition challenges that could delay implementation and increase costs for small-business-owners and defense-industry-workers reliant on stable supply chains.",
      "Repurposing and restarting closed nuclear plants for military microgrids could provoke community resistance and raise security concerns among local residents, especially in rural communities with little prior exposure to nuclear facilities.",
      "The use of Defense Production Act authorities to secure nuclear material supply chains may limit market competition and place burdens on small and medium-sized companies in the nuclear sector, potentially crowding out innovation."
