    "summary": "This executive order supports active duty service members and military veterans in becoming credentialed merchant mariners by recognizing their military training and experience. It directs relevant agencies to identify qualifying military skills, waive or pay fees for credentialing, and provide resources to help veterans transition into maritime careers to strengthen the U.S. merchant marine workforce.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The waiver or payment of credentialing fees by the military may strain defense budgets, potentially impacting other military readiness programs.",
      "The recognition of military training for merchant marine credentialing could create bottlenecks or delays if military and Coast Guard evaluative authorities do not coordinate effectively, hindering timely transitions for service members and veterans.",
      "Focusing recruitment primarily on veterans and active duty service members may limit opportunities for civilian maritime workers, potentially affecting the broader merchant marine workforce diversity and availability.",
      "There may be geographic disparities in access to credentialing support and resources for veterans and active duty members depending on their location, which could exacerbate inequities in maritime career opportunities."
