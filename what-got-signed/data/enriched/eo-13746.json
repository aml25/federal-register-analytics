    "summary": "This executive order establishes a working group within the U.S. government to coordinate efforts under the Power Africa initiative, which aims to expand access to electricity and increase clean energy generation in Sub-Saharan Africa. The order directs the U.S. Agency for International Development to lead the initiative, facilitate multi-agency collaboration, and support partnerships with African governments and the private sector to help grow energy infrastructure and improve power access across the region.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The initiative’s focus on renewable energy and infrastructure development may disproportionately benefit entrepreneurs and small business owners in Sub-Saharan Africa but could inadvertently marginalize informal or rural energy providers.",
      "Efforts to rapidly expand electricity access risk neglecting long-term environmental sustainability or community input, possibly leading to resistance from local populations identified as citizens of specific countries by EO designation.",
      "Dependence on U.S. agencies and private sector investment might prioritize projects that favor U.S. economic interests over equitable local community development impacting renewable energy workers.",
      "Implementation complexity and interagency coordination challenges could delay benefits to targeted populations, reducing the effectiveness of the initiative for entrepreneurs and renewable energy workers."
