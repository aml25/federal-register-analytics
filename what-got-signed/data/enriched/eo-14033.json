    "potential_concerns": [
      "The broad scope of individuals and entities sanctioned under EO 14033 could lead to difficulties in accurately targeting only those responsible for destabilization, inadvertently impacting innocent foreign nationals and visa holders from the Western Balkans.",
      "Suspension of entry into the United States for persons contributing to destabilization may strain diplomatic relations and limit opportunities for legitimate business, educational, or cultural exchanges involving corporations and visa holders connected to the region.",
      "The designation criteria related to corruption and human rights abuses may face challenges in consistent enforcement, potentially causing legal ambiguities for U.S. persons and businesses required to avoid transactions with sanctioned entities.",
      "Collateral economic impacts on corporations and businesses reliant on ties to the Western Balkans could indirectly affect U.S. workers and economic interests, despite not being the direct target of the sanctions."
