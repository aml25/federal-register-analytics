      "Efforts to cut waste and increase efficiency may lead to reduced contract opportunities and financial burdens for federal contractors, potentially impacting their business sustainability.",
      "Initiatives to eliminate program duplication and consolidate functions could result in job losses or decreased demand for services provided by federal contractors.",
      "Implementation of stringent performance metrics and frequent data-driven reviews might increase administrative burdens on agencies that rely on contractors, indirectly affecting contract terms and stability.",
      "The drive to reduce discretionary spending such as consultants and travel could disproportionately affect small or specialized contractors who depend on government contracts for survival."
