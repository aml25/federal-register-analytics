    "summary": "This executive order imposes additional tariffs on goods imported from Canada to address the flow of illicit drugs, particularly fentanyl, across the northern U.S. border. The order expands a national emergency declaration and uses economic measures to pressure Canada into cooperating more effectively to stop drug trafficking and illegal migration.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The additional 25% tariffs on Canadian goods may increase costs for small business owners and consumers in the U.S., especially affecting border communities reliant on cross-border trade.",
      "Heightened tariffs could provoke Canadian retaliation, further disrupting trade and harming U.S. corporations and consumers economically.",
      "The order's reliance on economic pressure could strain U.S.-Canada diplomatic relations, complicating cooperative efforts on border security and opioid crisis interventions.",
      "Law enforcement officers at federal and state/local levels may face operational challenges if increased tariffs reduce resources or complicate cross-border collaboration with Canadian partners.",
      "The policy may inadequately address illicit drug flows by focusing on tariffs rather than direct law enforcement and public health interventions, potentially prolonging opioid-related harms among U.S. citizens in affected communities."
