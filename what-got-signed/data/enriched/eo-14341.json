    "summary": "This executive order directs the federal government to prioritize prosecuting individuals who desecrate the American Flag, particularly when such acts incite violence or violate other laws. It also authorizes denying or revoking immigration benefits for foreign nationals who engage in flag desecration under certain circumstances. The goal is to restore respect for the flag and prevent violence linked to its desecration.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Prioritizing prosecution of flag desecration may lead to disproportionate enforcement against lawful permanent residents and naturalized citizens engaging in protected political expression under the First Amendment, implicating criminal-justice-reform concerns.",
      "Denying or revoking immigration benefits for foreign nationals who desecrate the flag risks conflating political expression with unlawful behavior, potentially violating constitutional protections and harming visa holders and undocumented immigrants.",
      "The focus on flag desecration as a national security threat could result in selective criminalization or profiling of minority immigrant communities, raising concerns related to homeland security and hate crimes against foreign nationals and naturalized citizens.",
      "Ambiguity in distinguishing lawful protest from incitement of violence may lead to uneven application of laws across demographic groups, risking civil rights violations among U.S. citizens from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds."
