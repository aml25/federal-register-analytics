    "potential_concerns": [
      "The focus on government IT modernization and digitization may unintentionally exclude or disadvantage seniors-elderly and individuals-with-disabilities who may face challenges accessing or using updated digital services.",
      "Enhanced interagency coordination and intelligence sharing on cybersecurity threats could raise privacy concerns for U.S. citizens if sensitive personal data is not adequately protected or overly shared across agencies.",
      "The establishment of a centralized technology council might lead to bureaucratic delays or prioritization conflicts that slow down improvements in digital services, negatively impacting users dependent on timely government support.",
      "Insufficient attention to equitable digital service delivery could exacerbate existing disparities affecting rural-communities and low-income individuals-families who may have limited internet access or digital literacy."
