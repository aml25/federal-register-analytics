    "potential_concerns": [
      "The centralized Executive Committee structure may slow interagency responsiveness during emergencies, potentially impacting military personnel who rely on rapid federal mission continuity.",
      "Emphasis on continuity of National Essential Functions could inadvertently deprioritize emerging threats or non-traditional risks, leaving intelligence community personnel exposed to evolving vulnerabilities.",
      "The increased focus on proactive risk management might lead to expanded surveillance or security measures that could raise privacy concerns within agencies involved in homeland-security.",
      "Budget constraints and appropriations dependency might limit effective implementation, undermining the resilience efforts intended to protect federal mission-critical operations."
