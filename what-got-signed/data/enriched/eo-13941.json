    "potential_concerns": [
      "Extending telehealth flexibilities beyond the public health emergency may create reimbursement challenges or exacerbate inequities for rural healthcare providers if payment models do not adequately compensate their costs or patient complexities.",
      "Rural communities might still face barriers to telehealth access due to insufficient broadband infrastructure despite the order’s calls for investment, limiting the intended improvements in healthcare access.",
      "Healthcare workers in rural areas may experience increased workload or responsibility without commensurate resource support as telehealth services expand, potentially affecting quality of care delivered to patients.",
      "Medicare beneficiaries in rural communities could encounter difficulties if telehealth services are not fully integrated with traditional in-person care or if regulatory changes create confusion around coverage and eligibility."
