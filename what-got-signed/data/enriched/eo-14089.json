      "Coordination across multiple federal offices and initiatives might cause bureaucratic delays in implementing council recommendations.",
      "Funding and resource allocation may be insufficient to fully support the council’s activities and effectiveness.",
      "There is potential controversy over balancing foreign policy goals with domestic equity efforts, which could complicate policy priorities."
