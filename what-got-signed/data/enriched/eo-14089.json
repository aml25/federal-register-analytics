    "potential_concerns": [
      "The Advisory Council's focus on African Diaspora engagement could raise questions about equitable resource allocation among other racial or immigrant groups, potentially causing perceptions of exclusivity among non-African minority communities.",
      "Implementation of trade and investment initiatives through programs like Prosper Africa might not sufficiently address socioeconomic disparities within the African Diaspora, especially among low-income or marginalized subsets of these communities.",
      "The voluntary and uncompensated nature of the Advisory Council membership could limit participation diversity, excluding less affluent or time-constrained African Diaspora members from meaningful engagement.",
      "Efforts to strengthen U.S.-Africa ties via the Diaspora might unintentionally overlook or insufficiently integrate the needs of recent African immigrants versus African Americans who are descendants of enslaved people, potentially causing intra-community tensions.",
      "Collaboration efforts that engage public- and private-sector entities may inadvertently favor established businesses and professionals, leaving behind informal workers or immigrant visa holders lacking formal economic opportunities."
