      "Improving information sharing requirements might raise privacy or civil liberties concerns if sensitive data is not adequately protected.",
      "Mandating rapid adoption of technologies like multi-factor authentication could be challenging for some agencies due to legacy systems or resource constraints.",
      "Standardizing contract language for security may increase compliance costs and complexity for private-sector service providers and contractors.",
      "The focus on software supply chain security could slow down software procurement and development due to stringent new requirements and auditing.",
      "Coordinating across many agencies and stakeholders for unified cybersecurity measures may face bureaucratic delays and inconsistent implementation."
