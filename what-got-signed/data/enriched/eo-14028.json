    "potential_concerns": [
      "The order's stringent cybersecurity requirements and reporting obligations on federal contractors, especially IT and OT providers, may impose significant compliance burdens and costs on small business owners and technology workers, potentially limiting market competition and innovation.",
      "Mandatory sharing of cyber incident data with federal agencies could raise privacy concerns for contractors and their personnel, including technology and cybersecurity professionals, especially regarding sensitive proprietary or operational information.",
      "The rapid adoption mandates for Zero Trust Architecture and multi-factor authentication may overwhelm agencies and contractors lacking sufficient resources or expertise, leading to implementation challenges for cybersecurity professionals and technology workers.",
      "Requirements for software vendors to provide Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and adhere to strict supply chain security standards could increase development and operational costs disproportionately impacting small software businesses and their workforce.",
      "Expanded government access to logs and monitoring information, while intended to improve cybersecurity, may increase risks of sensitive data exposure or misuse affecting contractors and technology workers involved with federal information systems."
