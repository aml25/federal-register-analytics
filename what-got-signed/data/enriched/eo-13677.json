It establishes a working group to develop tools, share information, and track progress to help vulnerable countries better prepare for and adapt to the impacts of climate change, while also encouraging climate mitigation efforts internationally.",

      "International aid recipients may face delays or reductions in funding for urgent development needs due to the added climate-risk assessment requirements, impacting the timeliness of aid delivery.",
      "Foreign governments in vulnerable countries might experience challenges in aligning U.S. climate-resilient development approaches with their existing national development priorities, potentially causing political or operational friction.",
      "Environmental justice communities in developing countries could be unintentionally marginalized if climate resilience investments prioritize large-scale infrastructure over local, grassroots adaptation measures that address inequities.",
      "The complexity of interagency coordination and reporting may slow down project approvals and implementation, reducing the effectiveness of development assistance to vulnerable populations.",
      "Emphasis on climate resilience might inadvertently divert resources from other critical development issues, such as poverty alleviation or health, impacting international aid recipients reliant on comprehensive support."
