    "potential_concerns": [
      "The continued operation of certain federal advisory committees may advantage established interest groups such as veterans and minority educational institutions while potentially limiting opportunities for emerging or underrepresented populations.",
      "Assigning advisory committees to the heads of federal departments could reduce transparency or independence of advice affecting diverse demographic groups like African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, Asian Americans, and Native Americans.",
      "Maintaining numerous advisory committees may create bureaucratic inefficiencies detracting from substantive policy improvements relevant to the populations these committees serve.",
      "Some advisory committees focus on specialized communities (e.g., HBCU students or veterans) and risks exist that political priorities might deprioritize the committees’ effectiveness in representing these populations’ needs."
