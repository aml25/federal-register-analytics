      "The reinstatement of monument protection policies may lead to increased enforcement actions that could raise tensions with protestors or civil rights advocates.",
      "Funding for the task force via the Department of Defense may divert resources from other defense priorities or complicate budget allocations.",
      "The expansion and accelerated inclusion process for the National Garden of American Heroes could generate debate over which historical figures are honored and possible politicization.",
      "Coordinating numerous federal agencies for a large-scale event may face bureaucratic delays and logistical challenges that hinder effective implementation.",
      "The order lacks explicit provisions addressing inclusivity or representation in the celebration, which might provoke criticism regarding the historical narrative presented."
