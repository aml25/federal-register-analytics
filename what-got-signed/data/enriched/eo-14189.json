    "potential_concerns": [
      "The reinstatement of protection against monument vandalism may lead to increased federal law enforcement actions that disproportionately affect Tribal Communities and veterans involved in protests or demonstrations.",
      "Funding and administrative support for Task Force 250 housed within the Department of Defense may divert resources from military personnel and veterans’ programs, causing negative impacts on their services.",
      "The emphasis on a particular patriotic narrative commemorated by the National Garden of American Heroes could marginalize some Indigenous Peoples and Tribal Communities whose historical experiences and perspectives may be underrepresented or overlooked.",
      "Taxpayers may face increased fiscal burdens due to the costs of the large-scale celebration and monument preservation efforts mandated by this executive order without clear limitations on appropriations.",
      "Heightened homeland security measures around the celebrations might result in restrictions or surveillance on law enforcement officers and military personnel, potentially affecting their operational duties and civil liberties."
