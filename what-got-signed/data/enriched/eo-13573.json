      "The blocking of property and financial transactions with senior Syrian government officials (foreign-government-officials) and their affiliates may escalate economic hardship for ordinary Syrian citizens (citizens-of-specific-countries-by-eo-designation) due to potential indirect economic fallout.",
      "Sanctions targeting Syrian entities could disrupt legitimate business activities of U.S. corporations (corporations-businesses) involved in the region, raising compliance challenges and increasing risk of inadvertent violations.",
      "The broad definition of persons and entities subject to blocking may lead to difficulties in precisely identifying sanctioned targets, increasing the risk of overbreadth affecting non-designated Syrian populations and affiliated businesses.",
      "Restrictions on donations and financial support may unintentionally impede humanitarian aid reaching vulnerable populations in Syria, complicating international human rights and humanitarian efforts."
