      "The increased enforcement coordination could raise concerns about the protection of sensitive business information for corporations and security clearance holders, with risks of information leaks or misuse within federal agencies.",
      "Federal law enforcement and intelligence personnel may encounter challenges balancing thorough export enforcement with respecting commercial confidentiality and proprietary technology protections."
