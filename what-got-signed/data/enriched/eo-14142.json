The order continues to support enforcement actions tied to blocking property and restricting entry of persons contributing to the situation in Syria.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The expansion of sanctions could significantly harm Syrian citizens and businesses by restricting access to international finance and commerce, exacerbating economic hardship.",
      "Broad definitions targeting entities that 'materially assist or support' sanctioned persons may unintentionally affect third-party foreign businesses and complicate compliance for multinational corporations.",
      "The continued blocking of property and suspension of entry may impact foreign nationals connected to Syria, including refugees or diaspora communities, raising humanitarian and diplomatic challenges.",
      "Removal of specific language about Turkey's military actions might reduce transparency about regional actors, leading to concerns around selective enforcement or geopolitical bias in sanctions."
