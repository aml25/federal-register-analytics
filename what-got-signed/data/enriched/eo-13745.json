      "The delegation to the OPM Director may lead to inconsistent implementation of emergency leave transfer programs across federal agencies, potentially disadvantaging some federal employees during crises.",
      "Disaster-affected communities relying on federal employees for emergency response may experience delays or reduced effectiveness if leave transfer programs are not well-coordinated or sufficiently utilized.",
      "Without clear communication or standardized criteria, some federal employees might be unaware of the availability or eligibility of emergency leave transfers, limiting the intended benefit of the program.",
      "Consultation with the Office of Management and Budget may prioritize budget constraints over employee needs, potentially restricting the scope or duration of emergency leave transfer programs."
