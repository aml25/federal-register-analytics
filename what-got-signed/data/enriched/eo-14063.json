    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to use project labor agreements for large-scale federal construction projects to help ensure these projects are completed efficiently and on time. It requires contractors to negotiate agreements that prevent labor disputes like strikes, promote smooth collaboration, and support small businesses, while allowing for certain exceptions. The order also sets requirements for reporting, training, and regulatory implementation.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Requiring project labor agreements on large-scale federal projects could limit contracting opportunities for non-union workers and firms, potentially reducing competition and disadvantaging small businesses that are non-union affiliated.",
      "The mandatory use of project labor agreements may increase labor costs or administrative burdens for federal contractors, which could be passed down as project budget increases or delays affecting construction-workers and small-business-owners.",
      "The order’s exception criteria and reporting requirements might create inconsistent application across agencies, causing uncertainty and potentially uneven benefits for union-members and construction-workers depending on project location and agency enforcement.",
      "While aiming to support small businesses, overly stringent project labor agreement terms could unintentionally exclude small non-union contractors if negotiations favor union-affiliated entities, thereby contradicting small-business-support goals."
