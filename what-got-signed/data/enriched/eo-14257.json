    "summary": "This executive order declares a national emergency due to large and persistent U.S. trade deficits that threaten economic and national security, and establishes additional tariffs on imports from all trading partners to promote reciprocal trade practices. It aims to protect and revitalize U.S. manufacturing, including critical defense industries, and address unfair foreign trade barriers that suppress U.S. economic competitiveness.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The additional tariffs and trade restrictions could lead to retaliatory tariffs from trading partners, escalating trade disputes and harming U.S. exporters.",
      "Increased tariffs might raise costs for U.S. consumers and businesses relying on imported intermediate goods, potentially slowing economic growth or increasing inflation.",
      "Complex rules regarding U.S. content and exemptions may create compliance challenges and burdens for importers and Customs authorities.",
      "The broad use of national emergency powers to impose tariffs could face legal challenges related to the scope of presidential authority under trade laws.",
      "Excluding certain critical goods and trade agreements could limit the effectiveness of the tariffs in achieving full reciprocity and trade balance improvements."
