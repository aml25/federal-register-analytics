      "The established order of succession might concentrate power within specific senior military leaders, potentially impacting military decision-making and readiness for active duty personnel.",
      "If succession rules exclude acting officials, this could delay leadership continuity during crises, adversely affecting military personnel's operational stability.",
      "The President's discretion to depart from the prescribed order may introduce political considerations into military leadership succession, raising concerns among active-duty members about impartiality and stability.",
      "Veterans and active military personnel might be indirectly affected by any leadership disruptions that impair force structure or readiness during a Secretary of Defense vacancy or incapacity."
