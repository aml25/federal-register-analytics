The goal is to protect American consumers by ensuring affordable food prices and addressing any national security risks related to the food supply.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Efforts to root out anti-competitive behavior and price fixing may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and compliance costs for domestic and foreign-controlled corporations, potentially impacting large-corporation employees and business operations.",
      "Stringent investigation of foreign-controlled food supply companies may create diplomatic tensions or lead to retaliatory measures affecting foreign nationals involved in U.S. food industries.",
      "Small business owners and agricultural workers could face short-term supply disruptions or price volatility during investigations and enforcement actions, potentially affecting their livelihoods.",
      "While consumers and food-insecure populations may benefit from more competitive pricing, unintended delays or reduced availability of certain food products might temporarily worsen access for vulnerable groups during enforcement actions.",
      "There is a risk that the focus on foreign-controlled entities could inadvertently disadvantage legitimate foreign investment, impacting economic competitiveness in the food supply chain."
