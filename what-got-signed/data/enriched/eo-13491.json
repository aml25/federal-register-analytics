      "The prohibition on unauthorized interrogation techniques may limit intelligence-community-personnel and military-personnel-active-duty in using aggressive methods they believe necessary for effective intelligence gathering, potentially impacting national security outcomes (theme: intelligence-operations).",
      "Closing CIA-operated secret detention facilities could disrupt existing detention and interrogation protocols, causing operational challenges for intelligence-community-personnel tasked with counterterrorism and detention policy management (theme: detention-policy-guantanamo).",
      "Strict adherence to Army Field Manual standards may reduce flexibility for federal law-enforcement-officers-federal to employ non-coercive but innovative interrogation techniques, possibly affecting law enforcement investigations (theme: human-rights-international).",
      "The establishment of an interagency Special Task Force places oversight burdens that may slow down decision-making processes regarding interrogation and transfer policies, potentially affecting timely responses by military-personnel-active-duty and intelligence-community-personnel (theme: presidential-commissions-task-forces)."
