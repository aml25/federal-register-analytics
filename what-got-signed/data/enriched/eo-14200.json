    "summary": "This executive order updates a previous order on tariffs related to synthetic opioids coming from China by modifying rules about when de minimis (very small-value) shipments can be duty-free. It establishes that duty-free treatment for certain covered articles will stop once the Secretary of Commerce confirms that systems are in place to properly collect tariffs on these items.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Small importers and international shippers may face increased costs and administrative burdens due to removal of duty-free treatment on de minimis shipments.",
      "There may be implementation challenges ensuring timely and accurate notification by the Secretary of Commerce about tariff collection systems being adequate.",
      "The changes could slow down delivery and increase prices of low-value shipments, impacting consumers and small businesses reliant on imports from China.",
      "Trade relations with China might be strained further by tightening tariff enforcement on synthetic opioid-related goods.",
      "Ambiguity in what constitutes adequate systems for tariff collection could lead to inconsistent enforcement or legal disputes."
