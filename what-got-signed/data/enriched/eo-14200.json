    "summary": "This executive order modifies a previous order that imposes duties (tariffs) on synthetic opioid-related products coming from China. It changes the rules so that low-value shipments that were previously duty-free will no longer be exempt once the government has systems in place to collect applicable tariffs more effectively.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Increasing tariffs on synthetic opioid-related products from China may raise costs for small businesses that rely on chemical precursors or pharmaceuticals, potentially leading to higher consumer prices.",
      "Removing duty-free exemptions for low-value shipments could slow down the import process, impacting healthcare workers' timely access to important medical supplies related to synthetic opioids and pain management.",
      "The order's focus on disrupting the opioid supply chain might inadvertently push illicit opioid manufacturing further underground, complicating efforts for state and local law enforcement officers to address local opioid crises.",
      "Patients could face reduced availability or increased costs of legally imported opioid medications and related supplies, possibly affecting treatment outcomes for individuals with chronic pain."
