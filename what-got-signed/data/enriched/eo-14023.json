      "The Commission's recommendations could lead to significant changes in the Supreme Court that directly affect all U.S. citizens' rights and legal precedents, raising concerns among birthright and naturalized citizens about the stability of constitutional protections.",
      "The study and subsequent reforms might politicize the Supreme Court further, potentially undermining public trust in the judiciary among diverse U.S. citizen groups.",
      "As the Commission solicits public input, there may be disparities in who participates, possibly marginalizing voices from naturalized citizens and birthright citizens in less accessible or underrepresented communities.",
      "Delays or controversies arising from the Commission's recommendations could create legal uncertainty, affecting U.S. citizens' confidence in the judicial system."
