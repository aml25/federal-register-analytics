      "Accelerated adoption of AI technologies may lead to disparities in access to advanced treatments, disproportionately affecting patients-general from underserved or rural communities who may not benefit equally.",
      "There is a risk that prioritizing AI-driven solutions could divert funding and attention from non-AI pediatric cancer research approaches, affecting the broad scientific-researchers community working with varied methodologies.",
      "Healthcare-workers may face challenges in adapting to new AI-driven diagnostic and treatment protocols, impacting clinical workflows and requiring additional training and resources."
