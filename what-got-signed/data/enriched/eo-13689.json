    "potential_concerns": [
      "The enhanced interagency coordination and federal emphasis on sovereignty and national defense could inadvertently marginalize Alaska Native tribes and their tribal governments if consultation processes are insufficiently meaningful or inclusive.",
      "Accelerated climate-change-driven development and increased maritime and resource extraction activities might negatively impact Alaska residents and environmental justice communities through environmental degradation and disruption of traditional livelihoods.",
      "Prioritization of security and economic interests could lead to inadequate attention to environmental stewardship, potentially causing unforeseen ecological harm to the Arctic region that scientific researchers and local communities depend on.",
      "Balancing scientific research promotion with respect for traditional knowledge raises potential conflicts about whose knowledge is prioritized in policy decisions, impacting Alaska Natives and scientific researchers alike.",
      "The creation of multiple working groups and steering committees may create bureaucratic complexity that delays timely responses to urgent climate and environmental challenges affecting vulnerable Arctic populations."
