It directs federal agencies to protect college athletics from harmful litigation, clarify student-athlete status, and support the role of college sports in developing Olympic athletes.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The prohibition on third-party pay-for-play payments may limit financial opportunities for student-athletes, particularly impacting revenue-generating sports and potentially disadvantaging athletes seeking fair compensation under the theme of federal-labor-management-relations.",
      "Mandating increased scholarships and roster spots for women's and non-revenue sports could strain athletic department budgets, possibly leading to resource reallocation away from revenue sports and affecting competitive balance among college-university-students.",
      "Clarifying student-athlete status to maximize educational benefits might restrict athletes’ rights to collective bargaining or unionization, raising concerns under federal-labor-management-relations for student-athletes.",
      "Efforts to shield college athletics from litigation could limit student-athletes' legal recourse against exploitative practices, disproportionately affecting college-university-students in vulnerable positions and raising gender-equality and title-ix enforcement challenges."
