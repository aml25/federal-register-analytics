    "summary": "This executive order seeks to protect and expand opportunities for college athletes, especially in women's and non-revenue sports, by setting policies against pay-for-play third-party payments and encouraging balance in scholarship distribution. It directs federal agencies to develop plans and take legal and regulatory actions to preserve the longstanding educational and developmental benefits of college sports and their integral role in American culture and international athletic success.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Eliminating third-party pay-for-play payments may drive compensation negotiations underground, making enforcement difficult and creating inconsistent application across states and institutions.",
      "Increased scholarship and roster requirements for non-revenue sports could strain budgets for smaller or less wealthy institutions, potentially leading to cuts in other areas or sports.",
      "The order’s directive to pursue litigation and enforcement actions could lead to protracted legal battles with uncertain outcomes, delaying stability in college sports.",
      "Ambiguity in defining legitimate vs. improper athlete compensation could create compliance challenges for schools and athletes.",
      "Restrictions on donor influence may reduce the overall funding available for collegiate athletics, possibly impacting the quality or breadth of programs."
