    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to take steps to help renters and homeowners avoid eviction and foreclosure during the COVID-19 pandemic by providing financial assistance and temporarily halting evictions when necessary. It aims to reduce homelessness and prevent further spread of COVID-19 by ensuring people have stable housing during the crisis.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The temporary halting of evictions and foreclosures could lead to financial strain on landlords and mortgage holders, possibly reducing housing availability for renters and homeowners in the long term, affecting low-income individuals negatively despite the policy's immediate benefits.",
      "Implementation challenges may arise in equitably distributing federal financial assistance, potentially leaving out certain vulnerable renters and homeowners, especially within African American and Hispanic communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19-related economic hardships.",
      "By focusing on preventing homelessness to curb COVID-19 spread, the order may inadvertently encourage increased shared housing arrangements that could still pose public health risks, particularly for seniors and individuals with chronic illnesses not explicitly protected under the order.",
      "The expiration of prior moratoria (e.g., CARES Act moratorium) and reliance on new administrative measures may create legal uncertainty and confusion for renters and homeowners, potentially leading to uneven enforcement and heightened risk of eviction among marginalized racial/ethnic groups."
