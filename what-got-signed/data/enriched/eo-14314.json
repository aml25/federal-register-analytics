    "summary": "This executive order directs the Secretary of the Interior to raise entrance fees for foreign tourists at U.S. national parks while keeping them affordable for U.S. residents. It aims to use the additional revenue to improve park infrastructure and visitor experiences, encourage international tourism, and review rules to prioritize access for Americans. The order also revokes a previous memorandum focused on diversity and inclusion in national parks.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Increasing entrance fees for foreign tourists may reduce international visitation and tourism revenue, negatively impacting visa-holders and foreign nationals seeking recreational opportunities in U.S. national parks.",
      "Prioritizing access and affordability for U.S. citizens could be perceived as discriminatory and may strain diplomatic relations with countries whose citizens face higher fees or restricted access.",
      "The revocation of diversity and inclusion initiatives risks undermining efforts to make national parks welcoming and accessible to racial/ethnic minorities and other underrepresented groups among U.S. citizens.",
      "Higher fees for nonresidents might shift visitation patterns, causing overcrowding by U.S. citizens while limiting revenue diversity, which could complicate sustainable park management.",
      "Efforts to rescind recreational access restrictions implemented by the prior administration might lead to environmental degradation or safety concerns if prior protective regulations are removed."
