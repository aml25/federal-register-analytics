    "potential_concerns": [
      "Prioritizing U.S. citizens and birthright citizens may lead to diminished diplomatic relations and cooperation with foreign governments and foreign nationals, potentially reducing global influence and strategic alliances.",
      "Naturalized citizens and lawful permanent residents could face unintended discrimination or reduced consideration in U.S. foreign policy decisions stressing 'America First,' affecting their international mobility or family members abroad.",
      "The America First policy might reduce U.S. participation in international agreements or foreign aid initiatives, which could harm global stability and increase security risks that ultimately affect U.S. citizens.",
      "There is a risk that this directive could foster an isolationist stance, limiting engagement with foreign governments and harming economic or security interests tied to multinational cooperation."
