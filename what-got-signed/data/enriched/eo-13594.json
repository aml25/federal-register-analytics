      "The phase-in of locality-based comparability payments per the Non-Foreign Area Retirement Equity Assurance Act of 2009 may lead to uneven pay increases impacting federal employees in different regions differently, potentially causing disparities and morale issues among federal-employees-civil-servants.",
      "Adjustments to pay rates for members of the uniformed services may affect military-personnel-active-duty retirement security if not aligned carefully with cost of living and benefits, possibly creating retention challenges.",
      "Veterans employed in the Veterans Health Administration might face complexities in pay adjustments that could influence staffing and quality of care, impacting veterans-healthcare outcomes.",
      "Foreign service officers may have concerns regarding changes in the Foreign Service Schedule pay that could affect international assignment incentives, possibly complicating U.S. diplomatic operations.",
      "Federal contractors might experience indirect competitive pressure due to federal pay adjustments, though not directly impacted, potentially affecting contractor labor costs and contract negotiations."
