    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to identify and restrict funding to states and local jurisdictions that have largely eliminated cash bail for individuals charged with serious crimes posing a threat to public safety. The goal is to ensure that people who are known threats are detained before trial, enhancing public safety and reducing repeat offenses while awaiting court proceedings.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Restricting funding to jurisdictions with cashless bail policies may disproportionately harm low-income individuals and families who cannot afford bail, exacerbating economic inequalities in the justice system.",
      "The order may increase pretrial detention rates, potentially leading to overcrowding in jails and increased burdens on defendants accused of crimes who have yet to be proven guilty.",
      "State and local law enforcement officers might face increased workloads and administrative challenges managing higher detention populations, potentially diverting resources from other public safety efforts.",
      "While intended to protect crime victims by detaining dangerous individuals pretrial, the order may also undermine ongoing criminal justice reform efforts aimed at reducing incarceration of nonviolent defendants."
