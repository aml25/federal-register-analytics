      "The expanded sanctions and definition could complicate diplomatic relations and negatively impact foreign governments and foreign nationals not directly involved in criminal activity.",
      "Economic sanctions targeting transnational criminal organizations may inadvertently harm corporations and legitimate businesses operating in regions where these groups exert influence.",
      "Enhanced enforcement actions could increase risks of profiling or wrongful targeting of foreign nationals, potentially violating legal protections and human rights.",
      "The broad definition of significant transnational criminal organizations may lead to challenges in clearly delineating legitimate versus illicit actors, impacting implementation consistency for law enforcement agencies."
