    "potential_concerns": [
      "Suspension of security clearances held by WilmerHale employees could disrupt federal operations and career prospects for security-clearance holders within the firm, impacting federal contracting and employment opportunities.",
      "Termination or review of government contracts related to WilmerHale may lead to financial instability for federal contractors connected to WilmerHale, resulting in broader economic and operational impacts across agencies.",
      "Restrictions on hiring WilmerHale employees by federal agencies could raise concerns about due process and potential employment discrimination for federal employees or applicants affiliated with the firm.",
      "Allegations of racial discrimination both by and against WilmerHale employees highlight potential complex racial and employment issues affecting African American employees and raise the risk of inconsistent application of anti-discrimination laws.",
      "Strict limitations on interactions with WilmerHale personnel in government buildings could inadvertently reduce collaboration between federal employees and external legal experts, potentially affecting the quality of legal counsel and government functions."
