      "Efforts to streamline SES hiring and reduce application burdens may unintentionally lower the rigor of candidate evaluation, potentially impacting federal leadership quality among federal employees.",
      "The mandate to increase SES rotational assignments could disrupt agency stability and mission continuity, imposing adjustment challenges on senior executives and subordinate federal employees.",
      "Pay-setting policies designed to ensure SES compensation exceeds that of their subordinates may create internal pay disparities that could affect morale among lower-grade federal employees.",
      "Diversity and inclusion initiatives, while intended to enhance representation in SES ranks, may face challenges in implementation that could lead to perceptions of preferential treatment or reverse discrimination.",
      "The phased implementation across agencies may result in uneven improvements and inconsistencies in executive development and accountability, potentially creating disparities in career advancement opportunities for SES members."
