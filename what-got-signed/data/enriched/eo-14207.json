      "Eliminating the Federal Executive Institute may reduce access to leadership training for federal employees, potentially degrading career advancement and management quality within the federal workforce.",
      "Dismantling an institution that focuses on bureaucratic leadership could unintentionally weaken organizational competence and institutional knowledge, negatively impacting effective federal workforce management.",
      "The revocation of previous executive orders establishing the Institute might create administrative uncertainty or gaps in leadership development unless alternative training programs are implemented.",
      "Without equivalent leadership development programs, the order risks fostering a less prepared federal managerial class, which may harm long-term government efficiency and service delivery."
