    "potential_concerns": [
      "The emphasis on interagency coordination may create bureaucratic complexity that delays direct resource delivery to Tribal Colleges and Native American students, limiting the immediate impact of educational equity efforts.",
      "Efforts to address educational disparities and promote Native language preservation could face challenges due to insufficient funding or lack of culturally competent educators, which would disproportionately affect Native American children and K-12 students.",
      "The focus on Native American women addresses gender disparities but may require additional safeguards to ensure that interventions do not inadvertently exclude or overlook other vulnerable groups within Tribal communities.",
      "Data collection improvements aimed at understanding educational attainment gaps might raise concerns regarding data privacy and sovereignty among Tribal Nations if not managed transparently and respectfully.",
      "The goal to expand career and technical education programs may conflict with some Tribal Nations' priorities if these programs are perceived as insufficiently aligned with cultural values or economic development goals."
