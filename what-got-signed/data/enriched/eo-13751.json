    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to prevent, control, and eradicate invasive species that threaten the environment, economy, agriculture, health, and national security. It strengthens coordination among federal, state, tribal, and international partners, updates the National Invasive Species Council's roles, and emphasizes addressing emerging issues like climate change and public health impacts related to invasive species.",

      "Efforts to control invasive species may impose additional regulatory burdens on agricultural workers and farmers, potentially increasing operational costs and impacting livelihoods.",
      "Military personnel could face challenges to readiness and training sites if invasive species control measures restrict access or require habitat modifications on training lands.",
      "Tribal communities may be disproportionately affected by invasive species control actions on reservation lands, potentially leading to conflicts over land use and cultural resource protection.",
      "Environmental justice communities could experience uneven benefits or risks from invasive species management, especially if public health impacts related to disease vectors are not equitably addressed.",
      "Integrating invasive species management with climate change policies may present coordination challenges that delay responses, thereby increasing risks to agriculture, military readiness, and vulnerable communities."
