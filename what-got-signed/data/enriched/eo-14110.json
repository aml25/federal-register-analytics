    "potential_concerns": [
      "Advanced AI deployment without robust safeguards may exacerbate biased and discriminatory outcomes affecting racial and ethnic minorities, individuals with disabilities, and low-income families, undermining the order’s equity goals.",
      "The reporting and regulatory burdens on developers of dual-use foundation models and providers of large-scale computing resources may disproportionately disadvantage startups and small businesses, limiting competition and innovation in the technology sector.",
      "Accelerated recruitment and hiring of AI talent within the Federal Government may create challenges related to workforce diversity and inclusion if not carefully managed, potentially disadvantaging existing federal employees.",
      "Increased use of AI in law enforcement and criminal justice raises concerns about privacy, surveillance, and civil rights violations, especially impacting historically marginalized communities and individuals interacting with the justice system.",
      "Efforts to monitor and regulate foreign access to AI training resources via IaaS providers may unintentionally impact visa-holders, international students, and foreign researchers collaborating in AI, potentially hindering global scientific exchange."
