      "The focus on racial equity and anti-bias training may face resistance from some federal law enforcement officers, potentially hindering effective recruitment and retention efforts.",
      "Establishing the National Law Enforcement Accountability Database could raise privacy and due process concerns for federal law enforcement officers, possibly leading to legal challenges or morale issues.",
      "Incarcerated individuals and formerly incarcerated returning citizens may benefit from enhanced reentry support, but implementation delays or inadequate resources could limit effectiveness and perpetuate existing disparities.",
      "Restrictions on certain military equipment transfers might negatively impact some federal law enforcement officers' operational readiness or perceived ability to respond to high-risk scenarios.",
      "Community trust-building measures may fall short if concerns about law enforcement misconduct investigations and disciplinary actions are not resolved promptly and transparently, particularly affecting communities of color such as African Americans and Hispanic / Latino Americans."
