    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to improve policing and the broader criminal justice system by increasing transparency, accountability, and community trust. It sets standards for law enforcement recruitment, use-of-force policies, data collection, officer wellness, and supports alternatives to incarceration and better reentry services. It also restricts the transfer of certain military equipment to local police and promotes the use of body cameras and technology with privacy safeguards.",
