    "potential_concerns": [
      "Efforts to advance gender equity may face resistance or backlash within certain government agencies or private sectors, potentially limiting effective implementation for women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and caregivers.",
      "The Council’s broad mandate, including global gender equity efforts, may dilute focus or resources from addressing urgent domestic issues affecting working-age women and marginalized groups.",
      "Implementation challenges coordinating multiple agencies and interagency communication might delay critical responses to gender-based violence and caregiving support, negatively impacting domestic violence survivors and caregivers.",
      "The emphasis on addressing COVID-19 impacts on women and girls may miss or inadequately serve intersectional populations such as women of color and LGBTQ+ individuals facing compounded disparities.",
      "International aid tied to the Council’s global gender equality goals could be viewed as politicized by some foreign governments, potentially complicating diplomatic relations with foreign government officials."
