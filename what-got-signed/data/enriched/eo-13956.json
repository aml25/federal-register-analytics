    "potential_concerns": [
      "Improved coordination and consolidation of multiple federal water programs may delay urgent infrastructure upgrades in rural and tribal communities due to bureaucratic realignment.",
      "Efforts to modernize water infrastructure could inadvertently prioritize large-scale projects over local water needs, potentially disadvantaging environmental justice communities that rely on localized water sources.",
      "Workforce development programs might not sufficiently reach or represent under-resourced rural and tribal communities, limiting training opportunities for local working-age adults and agricultural workers.",
      "Market-based voluntary water management practices could create disparities for small farmers and rural communities if they favor larger or more financially capable entities, affecting economic viability.",
      "Complex regulatory coordination to address multi-agency permitting requirements might increase administrative burdens on tribal governments and agricultural workers involved in water resource projects."
