      "The sanctions could significantly disrupt the operations and financial interests of Iranian-affiliated corporations and businesses, impacting global commerce and economies tied to Iran.",
      "Financial services workers and large corporation employees in U.S. institutions may face increased compliance burdens and risks due to prohibitions on transactions with ISA-sanctioned persons, possibly affecting jobs and business viability.",
      "Citizens of Iran, categorized under citizens-of-specific-countries-by-eo-designation, may experience indirect harm through economic destabilization and restricted access to goods and services due to these sanctions.",
      "The order’s strict blocking of property and transactions without prior notice may challenge due process protections for targeted entities and individuals with constitutional presence in the U.S."
