    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to modernize and streamline the regulation of agricultural biotechnology products, such as genetically engineered crops and animals, to ensure the process is science-based, efficient, and transparent. It also establishes plans for a unified online platform to help innovators navigate regulations, promotes educational and public engagement efforts, and supports international trade and outreach to expand markets for these products.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Streamlining regulations and exempting low-risk biotechnology products may reduce oversight leading to potential environmental or health risks that disproportionately impact agricultural workers and rural communities.",
      "Efforts to promote international acceptance and trade of biotech products could lead to trade conflicts or market restrictions affecting small business owners and entrepreneurs relying on agricultural biotechnology exports.",
      "Focusing regulatory decisions primarily on scientific and technical evidence without robust public engagement may undermine public confidence and acceptance among rural communities and general consumers.",
      "The planned regulatory streamlining might create barriers for small, private U.S. developers if updates and guidance are insufficiently clear or transparent, unintentionally stifling innovation among startups and small business owners."
