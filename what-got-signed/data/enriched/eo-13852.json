      "Federal employees required to work on December 5, 2018 for national security or critical functions may experience increased workload and stress, raising concerns about equitable application of exceptions.",
      "Closing federal departments even temporarily may disrupt public services, potentially reducing government efficiency and impacting citizens relying on timely federal assistance.",
      "The pay and leave treatment for federal employees on the closing day depends on existing statutes, which might create confusion or payroll inconsistencies, affecting workforce management.",
      "The commemorative closing might be viewed as politically symbolic rather than practical, raising questions about balancing historical patriotism with operational needs in federal agencies."
