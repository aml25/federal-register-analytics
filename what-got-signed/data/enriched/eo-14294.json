    "summary": "This executive order aims to reduce the overuse of criminal penalties for violating federal regulations. It requires federal agencies to identify and report all criminal regulatory offenses, promote transparency about mens rea (intent) requirements, discourage strict liability offenses, and ensure enforcement focuses on intentional wrongdoing. The goal is to protect ordinary Americans from unknowingly becoming criminals under complex regulations.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Reduced criminal enforcement of regulatory offenses might limit the ability of federal law enforcement officers to prosecute harmful misconduct, potentially undermining public safety.",
      "Small business owners and entrepreneurs may benefit from lower risk of unintended criminal liability, but inconsistent mens rea standards could create uncertainty and uneven enforcement.",
      "The disfavoring of strict liability offenses could lead to under-enforcement of regulations intended to protect public health and safety, risking harm to working-age adults and the broader public.",
      "Transparency requirements might impose additional administrative burdens on agencies and regulated entities, which could divert resources away from substantive enforcement actions."
