      "The temporary reduction of tariffs on Chinese imports may benefit small business owners and consumers through lower import costs but could negatively impact domestic manufacturing workers by increasing competition from Chinese goods.",
      "Large corporation employees and retail workers may face job insecurity or wage pressure due to continuing trade imbalances and tariff uncertainty affecting supply chains and product pricing.",
      "The 90-day suspension period creates uncertainty for businesses relying on tariff stability, potentially complicating inventory and pricing decisions for small business owners and manufacturing sectors.",
      "Ongoing national emergency declarations and tariff adjustments may heighten geopolitical tensions with China, potentially affecting sectors reliant on stable international trade relations such as manufacturing and retail."
