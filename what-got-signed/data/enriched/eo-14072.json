    "summary": "This executive order directs the federal government to protect and restore the nation's forests, including mature and old-growth forests, by enhancing wildfire prevention, promoting climate-smart forestry, and supporting sustainable local economies. It also commits to combating international deforestation through coordinated government efforts and advancing nature-based solutions to address climate change and improve ecosystem resilience.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Implementation of wildfire mitigation strategies and climate-smart forestry may restrict certain traditional land uses or access for tribal communities, potentially conflicting with treaty rights.",
      "Rural communities and small-business owners in the sustainable forest products sector could face economic disruption if stricter conservation policies limit timber harvesting.",
      "Agricultural workers and farmers might be indirectly impacted by changes in commodity supply chains due to international deforestation regulations, possibly affecting market access or costs.",
      "Efforts to combat international deforestation through import restrictions could increase compliance costs or supply uncertainties for U.S. businesses reliant on affected commodities.",
      "Scaling up nursery capacity and seed collection to meet reforestation goals may require significant coordination, risking delays or uneven benefits across regions, especially in rural and tribal areas."
