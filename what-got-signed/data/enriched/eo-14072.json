It also commits the U.S. to combat international deforestation through coordinated government actions and promotes nature-based solutions to address climate change and environmental resilience.",

      "Implementing collaborative, community-led economic plans may be challenging across diverse regions and sectors with competing interests.",
      "Ensuring sufficient funding and interagency coordination for the ambitious reforestation and conservation goals may face bureaucratic and budgetary obstacles."
