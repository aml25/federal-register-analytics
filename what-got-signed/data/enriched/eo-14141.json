    "summary": "This executive order directs the development and operation of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, including data centers and clean energy facilities, on federal lands to maintain U.S. leadership in AI technology and national security. It sets guidelines for site selection, energy sourcing, security measures, permitting, and public engagement, while promoting economic competitiveness, workforce standards, and environmental protections. The order also encourages international collaboration and the responsible, efficient growth of AI infrastructure powered by clean energy.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The rapid development and leasing of federal lands for AI infrastructure could negatively impact tribal communities and environmental justice communities by disrupting natural, cultural, and sacred sites, raising concerns under infrastructure-permitting and environmental-protection themes.",
      "Construction and operation of large-scale AI data centers may strain local resources and infrastructure in rural and urban communities, potentially increasing electricity costs and adversely affecting community wellbeing despite stated goals related to renewable-energy and energy-cost protections.",
      "Technology and construction workers might face labor-related challenges if high labor standards and worker protections are not effectively enforced during the accelerated buildout of AI infrastructure, raising worker-rights-protections concerns.",
      "Small business owners and startups could be at a competitive disadvantage if the selection criteria or leasing process favors large corporations, possibly undermining economic-competitiveness and the goal of fostering an open AI ecosystem.",
      "The increased demand for clean energy and transmission upgrades to power AI infrastructure may create supply chain bottlenecks and exacerbate tensions within the renewable energy sector workforce and local communities affected by new transmission projects."
