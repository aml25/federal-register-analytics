    "summary": "This executive order directs government agencies to detain families who enter the United States illegally together when possible, prioritize their immigration cases, and seeks to modify a court settlement to allow family detention during legal proceedings. It also calls on the Department of Defense and other agencies to provide appropriate facilities for holding these families. The order aims to enforce immigration laws strictly while attempting to minimize family separations given current legal and resource constraints.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Detaining undocumented immigrant families together may still result in psychological trauma and welfare risks for children-minors despite the intent to avoid separations, impacting their mental and physical health.",
      "Prioritizing immigration proceedings for detained families could strain immigration courts and lead to rushed or less thorough case reviews, potentially affecting asylum-seekers who need detailed evaluation of their claims.",
      "The use of Department of Defense and other government facilities for family detention may raise concerns about the suitability and humane conditions of such facilities, negatively affecting detained families and border-communities near these sites.",
      "Strict enforcement of improper entry laws without adequate Congress action could disproportionately impact undocumented-immigrants entering between ports of entry, potentially exacerbating family trauma and community tensions in border-communities."
