    "potential_concerns": [
      "The establishment of a second emergency board may prolong labor disputes, creating uncertainty and stress for union-members and transportation-workers relying on fair and timely dispute resolution.",
      "Maintaining existing working conditions during the investigation could limit the ability of some labor organizations to negotiate improvements or adjustments in response to changing circumstances.",
      "If the board's recommended settlement is perceived as biased or unreasonable by either the Long Island Rail Road Company or the unions, it may lead to further dissatisfaction or potential work stoppages impacting transportation infrastructure.",
      "The cost responsibility being assigned to the Department of Transportation might lead to concerns about resource allocation away from other transportation priorities benefiting workers and the public."
