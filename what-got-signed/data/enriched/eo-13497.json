    "summary": "This executive order cancels two previous executive orders related to regulatory planning and review, which had amended an earlier regulatory planning order. It directs government agencies to stop following any rules or policies based on those revoked orders, as long as doing so is allowed by law.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Revoking previous executive orders on regulatory planning could reduce oversight and accountability, potentially allowing agencies to enact regulations harmful to environmental justice communities and low-income individuals without robust review.",
      "The order may weaken protections or procedural safeguards that benefited consumers and public health, possibly leading to less stringent regulations affecting vulnerable populations such as individuals with disabilities or chronic illnesses.",
      "Eliminating these regulatory review processes could create regulatory uncertainty that adversely impacts small business owners who rely on predictable compliance standards.",
      "Without the revoked orders' review mechanisms, there is a risk that regulations could be influenced more heavily by political interests, potentially marginalizing minority racial/ethnic groups who benefit from equitable regulatory policies."
