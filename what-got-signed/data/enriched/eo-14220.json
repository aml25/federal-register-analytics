    "summary": "This executive order directs the Secretary of Commerce to investigate whether imports of copper and related materials threaten U.S. national security due to reliance on foreign sources. It seeks recommendations to secure and strengthen the domestic copper supply chain, potentially through tariffs, export controls, or incentives for increasing U.S. production capacity.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Increasing tariffs or import restrictions on copper could raise costs for U.S. manufacturers and downstream industries reliant on copper inputs.",
      "Efforts to expand domestic copper smelting and refining may face significant environmental, regulatory, and economic challenges delaying supply improvements.",
      "Heavy reliance on government incentives or protectionist measures might provoke retaliatory trade actions from foreign copper exporters.",
      "Focusing on a single critical mineral could divert attention and resources away from securing other essential supply chains.",
      "The 270-day investigation and resulting policy actions could create market uncertainty affecting commodity prices and investment decisions."
