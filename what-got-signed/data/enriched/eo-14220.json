    "summary": "This executive order directs the Secretary of Commerce to investigate how imports of copper affect U.S. national security due to the country's heavy reliance on foreign sources. It requires assessing risks from foreign supply concentration and recommending actions like tariffs or incentives to strengthen domestic copper production and supply chains.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Imposing tariffs or quotas on copper imports may increase costs for large corporations relying on copper inputs, which could be passed on to consumers, thereby negatively impacting affordability and competitiveness.",
      "Efforts to rapidly expand domestic copper mining and processing could face environmental and permitting challenges that delay benefits to renewable-energy-workers and defense-industry-workers reliant on secure copper supplies.",
      "Foreign suppliers may retaliate with trade restrictions or increased prices, threatening short-term supply chain stability and risking project delays in critical infrastructure sectors dependent on copper.",
      "Incentivizing domestic production might increase employment for miners-smelters-refiners but could also lead to labor shortages or require significant workforce retraining in regions currently underrepresented in copper industries."
