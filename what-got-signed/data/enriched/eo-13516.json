      "Revising PIAB composition limits and leadership structure could centralize decision-making, potentially reducing diverse oversight perspectives for intelligence-community-personnel.",
      "The requirement for PIAB members and associates to sign strict classification agreements may limit transparency and discourage some qualified individuals from participation, impacting security-clearance-holders' pool.",
      "Forwarding possible criminal intelligence activity information to the Attorney General could heighten legal scrutiny on intelligence operations, affecting operational practices and raising privacy concerns within intelligence-community personnel.",
      "Mandating information and assistance from DNI and department heads may increase bureaucratic burden and tension between advisory boards and executive agencies, potentially slowing intelligence oversight processes."
