      "The expanded sanctions targeting entities controlled by the Maduro regime may worsen economic conditions for Venezuelan citizens by further restricting access to vital resources and financial networks.",
      "Energy sector workers connected to PDVSA and related oil businesses could face job losses or reduced income due to heightened U.S. restrictions and sanctions.",
      "U.S. corporations and businesses with indirect dealings in Venezuela might suffer financial losses or legal risks from the broadened definition of the Venezuelan government under the order.",
      "The executive order could escalate political tensions and provoke retaliatory measures from the Maduro regime, potentially worsening human rights conditions and political instability affecting Venezuelan citizens.",
      "Venezuelan populations reliant on international oil revenues could inadvertently experience hardship due to disruptions in the energy sector caused by the sanctions."
