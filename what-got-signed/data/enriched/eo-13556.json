    "summary": "This executive order establishes a standardized government-wide program called Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) to manage unclassified information that requires protection or controlled sharing. It directs agencies to review their current information handling practices and work with the National Archives, which will oversee the program to ensure consistent marking, safeguarding, and dissemination policies across the federal government.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Standardizing CUI categories and dissemination controls may increase compliance burdens on security-clearance holders and federal/state law enforcement officers, potentially complicating information sharing and operational efficiency.",
      "Uniform marking and safeguarding protocols could unintentionally restrict authorized access to important unclassified information for stakeholders such as consumers, limiting transparency and public awareness.",
      "Inconsistent initial implementation timelines across agencies might lead to confusion among law enforcement personnel handling CUI, risking mishandling or over-classification of sensitive but unclassified information.",
      "The reliance on executive agency directives and interagency coordination might delay clear guidance, disproportionately impacting agencies with law enforcement roles that require timely and accurate information flow."
