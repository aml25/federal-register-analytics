    "potential_concerns": [
      "The Commission’s focus on protecting religious liberty might lead to conflicts with existing civil rights protections, potentially disadvantaging marginalized groups in educational and healthcare settings, such as LGBTQ+ individuals or women.",
      "Efforts to promote religious instruction and voluntary prayer in public schools may raise constitutional concerns and create divisiveness among parents, teachers, and students of different faiths or secular backgrounds.",
      "Faith-based organizations might receive preferential treatment in funding or tax status, potentially disadvantaging secular nonprofits or other community service providers.",
      "Military personnel and chaplains could face challenges balancing religious liberty protections with maintaining unit cohesion and non-discrimination policies in diverse armed forces.",
      "Broad definitions of religious liberty protections could inadvertently enable exemptions from vaccine mandates or healthcare conscience protections, potentially affecting public health outcomes."
