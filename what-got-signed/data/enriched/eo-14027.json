      "Coordination challenges between multiple U.S. agencies and foreign governments may lead to bureaucratic inefficiencies that limit timely responses to the global climate crisis.",
      "International organizations and foreign government officials may face elevated diplomatic pressures that complicate international negotiations, especially with countries prioritizing economic growth over climate policies."
