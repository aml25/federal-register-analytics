      "Efforts to protect reproductive healthcare access may expose women in low-income and rural communities to increased safety risks, requiring enhanced homeland security measures.",
      "Stronger data privacy protections for patients seeking reproductive services might be challenging to enforce consistently, potentially leaving patient health information vulnerable despite new guidelines.",
      "Healthcare workers providing abortion or contraceptive services could face heightened legal and social pressures in states with restrictive laws, complicating service delivery despite federal support.",
      "Public awareness campaigns might encounter resistance or backlash in certain regions, limiting their effectiveness in educating underserved populations about reproductive rights and services.",
      "Interagency coordination could lead to bureaucratic delays or inconsistent implementation across federal agencies, reducing the timeliness of access improvements for patients and providers."
