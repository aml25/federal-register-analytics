      "Efforts to address trade violations may benefit manufacturing-workers and agricultural-workers-farmers through improved trade terms, but could provoke retaliatory trade measures negatively impacting large-corporation-employees.",
      "Union-members might gain stronger protections and job security from addressing unfair trade practices, yet deeply renegotiating or terminating agreements may disrupt supply chains, adversely impacting small-business-owners reliant on international trade.",
      "Focus on trade enforcement and renegotiations under WTO rules risks escalating trade tensions, potentially leading to increased costs for consumers and workers in export-dependent sectors such as manufacturing and agriculture.",
      "There is a concern that prioritizing trade deficit reduction may lead to protectionist policies that unintentionally suppress innovation and domestic research and development, which could harm long-term competitiveness affecting manufacturing-workers and agricultural-workers-farmers."
