    "potential_concerns": [
      "The freeze on changing working conditions for 120 days may put financial and operational strain on transportation-workers and union-members during the dispute resolution period.",
      "While the Emergency Board aims to mediate fairly, union-members might feel pressured to accept unfavorable terms due to the limited 30-day investigation timeframe.",
      "Delays or prolonged disputes could disrupt New Jersey Transit operations, impacting transportation-workers who rely on stable work conditions and income.",
      "The limitation on unilateral changes to working conditions could constrain management's ability to respond quickly to safety or service issues, potentially affecting worker safety and transit reliability."
