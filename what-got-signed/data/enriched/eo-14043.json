      "Some federal employees may experience unintended negative health outcomes or distrust toward the federal workforce management due to perceived coercion or insufficient accommodation, possibly affecting productivity.",
      "The executive order may disproportionately impact subpopulations within the federal workforce who have historically lower vaccination rates, raising concerns about equity and targeted support measures."
