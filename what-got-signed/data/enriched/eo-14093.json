      "The prohibition on commercial spyware use poses operational challenges for intelligence-community-personnel and federal law enforcement officers needing advanced surveillance tools to counter threats, potentially limiting their capabilities (themes: intelligence-operations, cybersecurity-national-security).",
      "Restrictions on spyware procurement may slow rapid response efforts or intelligence sharing, creating interagency coordination difficulties, especially for agencies dependent on real-time data collection (theme: interagency-coordination).",
      "While the order protects u-s-citizens and journalists-media-professionals from foreign surveillance abuses, it may inadvertently limit the government’s ability to investigate legitimate threats without complex waiver processes or delays (themes: human-rights-international, cybersecurity-national-security).",
      "Foreign governments and officials adversely impacted by this order may resort to developing or acquiring alternative spyware, potentially escalating cyber countermeasures and undermining international cooperative norms (themes: cybersecurity-national-security, human-rights-international)."
