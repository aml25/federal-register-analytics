    "summary": "This executive order updates Coast Guard regulations to enhance security measures for U.S. vessels, ports, harbors, and waterfront facilities by including protections against cyber threats and authorizing more comprehensive enforcement actions. It expands Coast Guard authority to control access, inspect, and take possession of vessels or waterfront areas to prevent damage from physical or cyber incidents, and requires coordination with the Department of Justice and other agencies in enforcement.",
