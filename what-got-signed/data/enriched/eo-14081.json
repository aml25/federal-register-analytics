    "potential_concerns": [
      "Enhanced biotechnology and biomanufacturing innovation may exacerbate equity gaps if underserved communities, including low-income individuals and minority-serving educational institutions, do not receive adequate access to workforce development opportunities, potentially undermining the order's equity goals.",
      "The expansion of domestic biomanufacturing and intellectual property protections may impose competitive barriers for foreign nationals and international researchers, potentially leading to geopolitical tensions or restrictions on global scientific collaboration.",
      "Data sharing initiatives for the bioeconomy could raise privacy and security risks around biological data, posing threats to environmental justice communities and vulnerable populations if biosecurity measures are insufficient or unevenly enforced.",
      "Efforts to streamline biotechnology regulations might unintentionally favor large corporations or startups with resources to navigate reforms, potentially marginalizing small agricultural workers and farmers who depend on biotechnological advances.",
      "Ambitious biosafety, biosecurity, and supply chain resilience measures entail complex coordination that, if improperly implemented, may create unintended bureaucratic burdens for scientific researchers and technology workers, slowing innovation progress."
