    "summary": "This executive order temporarily pauses new investigations and enforcement actions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for 180 days while the Department of Justice reviews and updates its enforcement policies. The goal is to ensure FCPA enforcement better aligns with U.S. foreign policy and protects American economic interests and national security by reducing overreach that harms U.S. companies operating abroad.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Pausing FCPA enforcement may embolden corrupt practices abroad, undermining U.S. diplomatic relations and potentially harming international anti-corruption efforts.",
      "Reduced FCPA enforcement could decrease protections for whistleblowers exposing corporate misconduct, increasing risks for these individuals.",
      "Temporary suspension of enforcement might lead to increased reputational and legal risks for U.S. companies if foreign partners or competitors engage in corrupt practices unchecked.",
      "The pause in investigations may create uneven accountability, disadvantaging ethical corporations compared to those willing to exploit loopholes during the moratorium.",
      "Prioritizing economic competitiveness over strict enforcement could inadvertently weaken critical minerals and infrastructure supply chain security by enabling unethical business practices."
