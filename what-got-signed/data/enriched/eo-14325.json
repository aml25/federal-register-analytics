    "summary": "This executive order increases tariffs on certain Canadian goods to address the flow of illicit drugs, particularly fentanyl, across the northern U.S. border. It also establishes stronger penalties for goods transshipped from Canada to evade these duties and assigns government officials to monitor Canada's cooperation and recommend further actions if necessary.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Increasing tariffs on Canadian goods may harm U.S. corporations and businesses reliant on cross-border trade, risking job losses and higher prices for consumers.",
      "The higher tariffs and penalties to counteract transshipment evasion could lead to more aggressive border enforcement that disproportionately impacts lawful cross-border commerce and border communities.",
      "Limited Canadian cooperation may lead to further escalation of trade tensions and retaliatory tariffs, destabilizing bilateral relations and affecting broader economic sectors.",
      "Enhanced border-security and enforcement efforts could strain federal and state/local law enforcement resources, potentially diverting attention from other critical public safety priorities."
