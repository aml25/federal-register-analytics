    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to accelerate the safe integration and commercialization of drones (unmanned aircraft systems) and electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft into the U.S. airspace. It prioritizes strengthening the domestic drone industry, promoting exports of American-made drones, supporting technological innovation including AI for regulatory processes, and ensuring military access to trusted U.S. drones.",

      "Deployment of AI tools in waiver reviews could introduce biases or reduce transparency in regulatory decisions.",
      "Streamlining export controls might increase the risk of sensitive drone technologies being diverted to adversaries despite safeguards.",
      "Military prioritization of domestic drones may cause procurement challenges if commercial technology does not meet all defense requirements timely."
