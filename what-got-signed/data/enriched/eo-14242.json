    "potential_concerns": [
      "The closure of the Department of Education shifts significant responsibility to state and local governments, which may have uneven capacity and resources to manage education, negatively impacting K-12 and college students' educational quality and access.",
      "Eliminating federal support for diversity, equity, and inclusion programs risks undermining protections against discrimination, disproportionately harming students and educators from marginalized racial/ethnic groups and LGBTQ+ communities.",
      "The removal of federal oversight could weaken enforcement of civil rights in education, resulting in increased inequality and reduced access for vulnerable student populations.",
      "Teachers and educators may face inconsistencies in curriculum standards and funding across states, complicating career stability and instructional quality.",
      "The dismantling of the federal student loan management system without clear alternatives could disrupt financial aid delivery to college students, threatening their ability to afford higher education."
