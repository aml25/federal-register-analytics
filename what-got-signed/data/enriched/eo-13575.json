      "Enhanced federal engagement could increase bureaucratic complexity and slow delivery of services to rural-communities, reducing the effectiveness of the Council’s intended benefits.",
      "Integration of diverse agencies may lead to conflicting priorities that complicate policy development, adversely affecting small-business-owners and agricultural-workers-farmers who depend on streamlined support."
