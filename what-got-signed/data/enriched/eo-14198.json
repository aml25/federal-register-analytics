    "summary": "This executive order pauses the planned 25 percent tariff increase on Mexican imports to allow more time to evaluate Mexico's efforts to address illegal migration and illicit drug trafficking at the southern border. It directs continued assessment of the situation and threatens to reinstate tariffs if the crises worsen or if Mexico fails to take sufficient action.",

      "The pause on tariffs may delay economic pressure on the Government of Mexico, potentially prolonging security risks for border communities and undermining homeland security efforts.",
      "Undocumented immigrants and Hispanic/Latino Americans may face increased scrutiny or negative social impacts as enforcement actions intensify alongside tariff threats.",
      "Small business owners and large corporation employees reliant on Mexican imports could suffer from economic uncertainty and increased costs if tariffs are reinstated suddenly.",
      "Escalation of tariffs could disrupt supply chains, harming border communities economically and increasing tensions in an already fragile border region."
