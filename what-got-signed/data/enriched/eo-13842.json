    "summary": "This executive order allows the U.S. Marshals Service to hire Deputy U.S. Marshals and Criminal Investigators without following the usual competitive examination rules, making it easier to quickly fill positions with qualified candidates. After three years of satisfactory service, these employees can be converted to permanent positions without competition.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "By exempting Deputy U.S. Marshals and Criminal Investigators from competitive examining, the order may reduce transparency and equal opportunity in federal hiring for law enforcement positions.",
      "The non-competitive conversion to permanent status after three years could lead to retention of less qualified personnel within the federal law enforcement workforce.",
      "This hiring flexibility may disadvantage external applicants who rely on competitive exams to fairly compete for U.S. Marshals Service positions.",
      "Rapid hiring without competition may inadvertently lower hiring standards or result in less diversity within federal law enforcement officers.",
      "The shift in hiring authority could create perceptions of favoritism or reduce public trust in USMS workforce management practices."
