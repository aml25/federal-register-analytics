      "Stringent anti-trafficking enforcement efforts may disproportionately restrict small-business owners and communities engaged in legal wildlife trade, creating economic hardships.",
      "Increased international cooperation and capacity-building aid could face resistance or complications from foreign governments due to sovereignty concerns or differing legal frameworks.",
      "Enhanced law enforcement targeting transnational crime-cartels may lead to unintended disruptions for tribal communities reliant on wildlife resources for cultural and subsistence purposes.",
      "Efforts to reduce consumer demand for illegal wildlife products domestically could negatively affect consumers without providing sufficient alternatives, potentially driving black-market activity underground.",
      "Coordination challenges among multiple federal and state law enforcement agencies could hinder effective implementation and enforcement, straining resources of involved officers."
