      "Working-age adults who rely on federal services could experience negative impacts if AI applications lack transparency or result in inaccurate or unfair decisions, undermining public trust.",
      "Interagency coordination efforts may struggle to implement consistent AI governance, potentially causing uneven application of the order’s principles and resulting in disparities affecting vulnerable populations."
