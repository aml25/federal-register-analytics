      "Tribal-communities-reservations might experience delays or insufficient inclusion in decision-making processes despite the order’s emphasis on interagency coordination and advisory committees.",
      "Coastal-communities could be adversely affected if restoration projects prioritize ecological goals over local economic recovery, potentially hindering tourism or development opportunities."
