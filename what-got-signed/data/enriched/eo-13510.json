    "potential_concerns": [
      "The waiver of trade restrictions may enable Belarusian state-controlled corporations to access U.S. markets, potentially undermining U.S. foreign policy goals related to sanctions-country-specific measures.",
      "U.S. companies engaging in increased trade with Belarus might face reputational risks or secondary sanctions if Belarusian government entities misuse trade privileges.",
      "Citizens of Belarus may experience unintended economic impacts if the waiver prolongs support to a government with questionable human rights records or political repression.",
      "This waiver could complicate broader diplomatic efforts by signaling leniency, potentially reducing leverage in negotiations with Belarusian authorities."
