    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to share data with the Department of Commerce to help compile accurate citizenship information for the 2020 census by using administrative records, since the planned citizenship question could not be included. It also establishes an interagency working group to improve data access and directs efforts to acquire state-level records and consider including a citizenship question in future censuses to better understand and inform immigration policy and public programs.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The increased data sharing across agencies raises data-privacy concerns, particularly for noncitizen populations such as undocumented immigrants, asylum seekers, and visa holders who may fear misuse of their information despite Title 13 confidentiality protections.",
      "Efforts to compile more precise citizenship data may lead to undercounts or reluctance among immigrant communities to participate in census-related data collection, undermining the accuracy and representation of these populations.",
      "The order’s emphasis on obtaining state-level administrative records could create inconsistencies in data quality and availability, disproportionately affecting immigrants in states with less cooperative or more restrictive data-sharing policies.",
      "Within the population of lawful permanent residents and refugees, the increased focus on citizenship data may indirectly lead to policy shifts that restrict access to public benefits or increase surveillance, potentially chilling integration and assistance efforts.",
      "Targeting citizenship data to inform redistricting based on voter-eligible populations may disadvantage noncitizen residents, affecting political representation in communities with large immigrant populations, including naturalized and birthright citizens living among them."
