      "The establishment of the Emergency Board may delay resolution of labor disputes, potentially prolonging uncertainty and stress for union members and transportation workers.",
      "Maintaining status quo labor conditions during the investigation might limit workers' ability to negotiate improved terms, possibly leading to worker dissatisfaction or unrest.",
      "Large corporation employees, particularly railroad management, may face operational constraints and increased costs resulting from the board’s intervention, impacting business performance.",
      "There is a risk that the board's investigation and recommendations may not fully address complex underlying labor issues, causing recurring disputes that disrupt transportation infrastructure."
