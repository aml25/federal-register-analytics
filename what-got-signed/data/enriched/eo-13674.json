    "potential_concerns": [
      "The expanded federal quarantine authority could lead to restrictions on the liberty of patients-general, incarcerated-individuals, and undocumented-immigrants during outbreaks, raising human rights and civil liberties concerns.",
      "Implementation of quarantine measures might disproportionately affect incarcerated-individuals due to potentially limited healthcare access and overcrowding, exacerbating health risks.",
      "Enforcement actions under this order could result in stigmatization and fear among undocumented-immigrants, deterring them from seeking medical care and hindering public health efforts.",
      "The order’s broad criteria for quarantinable diseases might cause confusion or inconsistent application across jurisdictions, impacting patients-general who could face excessive or unnecessary quarantine measures."
