    "summary": "This executive order imposes sanctions on Iran by blocking property and financial transactions of certain Iranian officials and entities connected to the Supreme Leader. It also restricts entry into the United States of individuals linked to these sanctions and authorizes the Treasury Secretary to enforce financial penalties against foreign institutions that facilitate prohibited transactions. The goal is to respond to Iran's destabilizing activities and support of terrorism.",

      "The travel restrictions and entry bans on designated Iranian officials and associates may cause diplomatic tensions and affect visa holders connected to Iran by complicating lawful travel and international relations.",
      "Sanctions targeting foreign financial institutions facilitating transactions with sanctioned Iranian entities could lead to financial sector disruptions and overcompliance, negatively impacting global banks and their employees.",
      "Blocking property and assets of persons linked to Iran’s Supreme Leader risks extending economic hardship to broader foreign nationals and associated entities not directly involved in destabilizing activities, potentially affecting innocent parties.",
      "Restrictions on financial transactions and donations may inadvertently impact humanitarian efforts and international aid intended for civilians in Iran, raising concerns for visa holders and NGOs working in the region."
