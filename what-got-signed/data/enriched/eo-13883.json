    "summary": "This executive order directs the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to enforce sanctions on countries involved in proliferation activities, including prohibiting U.S. banks from making loans to those governments except for food or agricultural purposes. It also amends a previous executive order to delegate certain sanction-related authorities to the Treasury Department and establishes rules to prevent evasion of these sanctions.",

      "The sanctions may exacerbate economic hardships for citizens of targeted countries, potentially worsening humanitarian conditions.",
      "Restrictions on U.S. banks could complicate legitimate financial transactions and increase compliance burdens on financial services workers.",
      "Delegation of sanction authority to the Treasury may speed enforcement but reduce oversight, raising risks of inconsistent application affecting foreign governments.",
      "Efforts to prevent evasion might lead to overly broad or aggressive measures that disrupt lawful trade and financial operations involving targeted countries."
