    "potential_concerns": [
      "Reestablishing the Presidential Fitness Test may disproportionately impact children-minors and k-12-students with disabilities or chronic illnesses if accommodations are not adequately provided, potentially leading to exclusion or stigmatization.",
      "The emphasis on physical fitness and nutrition promotion might unintentionally marginalize youth-young-adults from low-income or food-insecure populations who lack access to quality nutrition or sports programs.",
      "Heightened focus on military readiness through youth fitness initiatives could pressure military-personnel-active-duty and related communities to prioritize physical standards that may not consider diverse abilities or community contexts.",
      "The reestablishment of a standardized fitness test in schools might spark concerns among parents and educators about increased testing burden and the potential reduction in time allocated to academic subjects or inclusive activities."
