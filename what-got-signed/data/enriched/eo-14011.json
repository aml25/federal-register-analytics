The task force is tasked with making recommendations to reunite these children with their families, providing support services, and preventing future family separations, with regular progress reports to the President until the mission is complete.",

      "Challenges in accurately identifying all separated children given incomplete or inconsistent records could delay reunification efforts.",
      "Reunification attempts may face legal or logistical barriers, especially if families are dispersed across countries or have mixed immigration statuses.",
      "The provision of services such as trauma and mental health support may be insufficient or unevenly distributed, impacting children’s well-being.",
      "Coordinating multiple federal agencies with differing priorities may slow implementation and reduce overall effectiveness.",
      "Some stakeholders may dispute the scope of family reunification or challenge the prioritization of resources under this order."
