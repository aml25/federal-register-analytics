      "Efforts to increase Medicare negotiation power and align drug pricing policies may lead to pushback or reduced innovation incentives among pharmaceutical corporations, potentially affecting the availability of new medications.",
      "Streamlining drug importation programs to lower costs could raise questions about drug safety and quality, impacting vulnerable populations such as seniors and low-income individuals who rely on affordable medications.",
      "Reforms aimed at reducing Medicare Part D premiums might inadvertently reduce coverage choices for seniors, potentially limiting access to specific drugs or pharmacy networks.",
      "Changes to Medicaid drug payment and rebate systems could complicate state program budgets and operations, potentially affecting Medicaid beneficiaries' access to medications in the short term."
