      "Redirecting funds previously allocated for services to undocumented immigrants toward veteran housing may reduce available resources for immigrant populations, potentially causing community tensions in urban areas.",
      "Efforts to restore accountability within the VA might lead to workforce instability or reductions that could temporarily disrupt healthcare delivery to veterans.",
      "The emphasis on restoring 'warrior ethos' and self-sufficiency may unintentionally stigmatize veterans struggling with chronic homelessness or mental health conditions, limiting their access to needed supportive services.",
      "Expanding the voucher program and centralizing housing support at the West Los Angeles campus may create access challenges for homeless veterans in rural or non-urban areas who cannot easily reach the facility.",
      "Increasing healthcare options including virtual services may disproportionately benefit working-age veterans but could be less effective or accessible for elderly veterans without adequate technology access."
