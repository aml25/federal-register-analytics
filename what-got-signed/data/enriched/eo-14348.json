    "summary": "This executive order strengthens U.S. government efforts to protect American citizens who are wrongfully detained in foreign countries. It authorizes the Secretary of State to designate countries that engage in or support wrongful detention, and outlines possible sanctions and travel restrictions against those countries. The order also sets criteria for lifting these designations when appropriate changes occur.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Sanctions and travel restrictions on designated countries may escalate diplomatic tensions, possibly putting U.S. citizens abroad at greater risk or complicating negotiations for the wrongful detainees' release.",
      "Designating a country as a State Sponsor of Wrongful Detention could negatively impact citizens of that country by limiting travel and trade, raising concerns about collective punishment of populations not involved in wrongful detentions.",
      "The criteria and process for designation and termination might lack transparency or be applied inconsistently, potentially leading to politicization or misuse affecting both U.S. nationals and foreign entities.",
      "Travel bans restricting use of U.S. passports to designated countries could inadvertently hinder family and business-related travel for U.S. citizens beyond those directly at risk, imposing broader burdens.",
      "Restricting foreign assistance and exports to designated countries could have unintended humanitarian or economic consequences that strain diplomatic relations and affect vulnerable populations beyond the targeted governments."
