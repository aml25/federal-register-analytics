    "potential_concerns": [
      "Efforts to promote pay equity and increase women’s participation in STEM fields may face resistance from entrenched industry cultures, potentially limiting their effectiveness for women and working-age adults employed in these sectors.",
      "The Council’s advisory-only role might limit the speed and enforceability of policy improvements, leaving women, girls, and individuals with disabilities with slower progress on critical issues like caregiving leave and violence prevention.",
      "Focus on women-owned small business international competitiveness could inadvertently overlook challenges faced by women-led businesses operating domestically or in underserved rural and minority communities.",
      "Interagency coordination required by the Council may create bureaucratic delays or inconsistent implementation across federal programs, causing uneven benefits for working-age women and girls.",
      "Without explicit funding increases, existing federal programs targeting women and girls may lack sufficient resources for meaningful expansion or evaluation, potentially hindering intended improvements in education, health care, and workplace management."
