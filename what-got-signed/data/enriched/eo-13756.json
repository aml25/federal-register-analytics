      "Veterans employed within the Veterans Health Administration might face unintentional challenges if pay adjustments do not keep pace with comparable private sector health jobs, affecting veteran healthcare staffing.",
      "Foreign Service officers' pay adjustments could impact diplomatic staffing levels or morale if salaries are not competitive internationally."
