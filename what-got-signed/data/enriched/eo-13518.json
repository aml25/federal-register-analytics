    "summary": "This executive order directs the federal government to increase hiring and support of veterans by creating an interagency council to coordinate efforts, establish agency-specific plans, and provide training and counseling programs. It aims to help veterans transition to civilian federal jobs by aligning their skills with government needs and promoting veterans' preference laws.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Prioritizing veterans in federal hiring could unintentionally slow hiring processes or limit opportunities for non-veteran working-age adults seeking federal employment, impacting overall federal workforce diversity and efficiency.",
      "Enhanced focus on veterans' preference and targeted recruitment may lead to perceived or actual unfairness among other qualified job applicants, potentially causing morale or legal challenges within federal agencies.",
      "Coordination among multiple federal agencies through the Council on Veterans Employment may encounter bureaucratic delays or inconsistent implementation, undermining the effectiveness of training and counseling programs for transitioning military personnel.",
      "Active-duty military personnel nearing transition might face mismatches between their skills and agency staffing needs despite counseling efforts, potentially leaving some veterans underemployed or unemployed after service.",
      "Focusing training and recruitment on certain key federal occupations may disadvantage veterans with skills that do not align clearly with those occupations, limiting the inclusiveness of the initiative."
