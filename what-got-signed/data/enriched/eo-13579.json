    "summary": "This executive order directs independent regulatory agencies to improve their rulemaking processes by encouraging public participation and careful analysis of the costs and benefits of regulations. It also requires these agencies to regularly review and update existing significant regulations to ensure they are effective and not overly burdensome, following principles similar to those that apply to executive agencies.",

      "The mandate for retrospective review of regulations may impose additional compliance and administrative costs on small-business-owners, potentially straining their resources despite aiming to reduce burdens.",
      "Encouraging greater public participation in rulemaking could slow regulatory processes, delaying benefits to consumers and public-school-communities who rely on timely protections and updates.",
      "Independent agencies adopting cost-benefit analyses similar to executive orders may prioritize economic efficiency over community health or educational equity, potentially disadvantaging vulnerable public-school-communities.",
      "Regular rule updates might create regulatory uncertainty, complicating planning for small-business-owners and potentially reducing consumer confidence in regulated products or services."
