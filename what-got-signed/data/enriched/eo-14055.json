    "summary": "This executive order requires federal contractors who win new service contracts to offer employment to qualified workers from the previous contractor to avoid layoffs and reduce service disruptions. It also encourages agencies to keep services performed in the same location when possible and sets procedures for enforcement and exceptions.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The requirement to offer jobs to predecessor employees may limit competition or increase contract costs.",
      "Some contractors might face challenges in fairly assessing which employees are qualified or suitable to rehire.",
      "Enforcement relies heavily on the Department of Labor, which may face resource constraints or delays in addressing violations.",
      "Exceptions granted by agencies could be used too broadly, undermining the order’s intent.",
      "The order does not cover relocation costs, which could discourage eligible workers from accepting new employment offers."
