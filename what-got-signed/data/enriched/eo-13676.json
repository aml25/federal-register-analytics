      "Implementation of stringent antibiotic stewardship programs may increase administrative burdens on healthcare-workers across diverse settings, potentially diverting time from direct patient care.",
      "Agricultural-workers-farmers could face economic challenges and operational adjustments due to restrictions on antibiotic use in livestock, impacting their livelihoods and food production practices.",
      "Patients-general, including veterans and military personnel, might experience limited access or delays in antibiotic treatments if new regulations restrict or delay the availability of certain antibiotic drugs.",
      "The success of national and international surveillance efforts relies heavily on interagency coordination, and any failure in data sharing could weaken responses impacting vulnerable populations relying on effective infection control.",
      "International cooperation efforts might raise concerns among global-health-populations and U.S. stakeholders about data privacy and sovereignty when sharing antibiotic resistance information across borders."
