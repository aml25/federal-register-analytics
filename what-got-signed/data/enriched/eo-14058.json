      "Efforts to modernize digital government services may unintentionally create accessibility barriers for individuals-with-disabilities lacking assistive technologies or digital literacy.",
      "Streamlining application and enrollment processes may inadequately protect privacy or civil rights safeguards, particularly impacting low-income individuals and underserved racial/ethnic groups such as native-americans-indigenous-peoples and undocumented immigrants.",
      "Consolidation of services and reliance on online platforms could disadvantage veterans and elderly Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries who may have limited internet access or prefer in-person assistance.",
      "Coordination across federal and state agencies to reduce paperwork burdens might face legal and bureaucratic challenges that delay relief to small-business-owners and tribal-governments relying heavily on timely federal assistance.",
      "Efforts to reduce 'time taxes' risk oversimplifying complex eligibility criteria, potentially excluding or confusing marginalized groups and undermining equitable access."
