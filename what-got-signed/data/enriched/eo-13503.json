      "The focus on economic competitiveness and investment could prioritize development projects that lead to gentrification, adversely impacting renters and longtime residents in urban communities.",
      "Nonprofit organizations engaged in urban development may encounter increased administrative burdens due to greater federal oversight and interagency coordination demands.",
      "Without dedicated funding guarantees, the effectiveness of the Office of Urban Affairs in addressing critical urban issues may be hampered, leaving vulnerable populations without expected improvements."
