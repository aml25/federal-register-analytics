    "potential_concerns": [
      "The focus on expanding youth sports participation may fail to adequately address barriers faced by children with disabilities, despite mention of consideration, potentially limiting their inclusion and benefit.",
      "Targeting low-income and food-insecure populations may uncover funding and resource challenges that hinder equitable access to nutritional programs and athletic facilities in underserved urban and rural communities.",
      "Emphasizing youth sports participation risks unintentionally privileging traditional team sports, which could exacerbate existing gender disparities affecting girls and women’s access to sports opportunities.",
      "The national strategy’s reliance on volunteer recruitment might be insufficient in economically distressed areas, creating gaps in program delivery and support for youth engagement in physical activity and nutrition."
