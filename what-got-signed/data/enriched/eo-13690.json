    "summary": "This executive order establishes a new federal standard to better manage flood risks for federally funded projects by considering current and future flood threats, including those caused by climate change. It updates existing floodplain management policies and requires agencies to seek public and stakeholder input before implementing the standard to improve community and federal asset resilience against flooding.",

      "The increased flood risk elevation requirements could impose higher construction and compliance costs on small-business-owners and renters/homeowners in coastal and disaster-affected communities, potentially limiting rebuilding or new development affordability.",
      "Low-income individuals and families in vulnerable floodplain areas may face displacement or housing insecurity if stricter flood management standards restrict development or increase insurance costs.",
      "Tribal communities and reservations located in flood-prone areas might have limited capacity or resources to meet the new federal flood risk standards, impacting their infrastructure development and resilience.",
      "Balancing the flexible approaches for determining floodplains may lead to inconsistent application across regions, resulting in uncertainty for local governments and communities in interpreting and complying with flood risk management guidance."
