    "potential_concerns": [
      "Stricter regulatory oversight aimed at protecting consumers and investors may increase compliance costs and operational burdens on cryptocurrency holders and startups, potentially reducing innovation and market participation.",
      "Efforts to mitigate illicit finance risks could lead to enhanced surveillance and data sharing requirements that may infringe on the privacy and civil liberties of cryptocurrency users, affecting their rights to privacy and possibly human rights.",
      "Low-income individuals who use digital assets to access financial services might face new barriers or reduced access due to increased regulation, potentially exacerbating financial exclusion despite the order’s goal to promote inclusion.",
      "Financial services workers could experience disruptions as the regulatory framework evolves rapidly, requiring retraining or adapting to new digital asset compliance standards, which might strain workforce capacity.",
      "International cooperation on standards for digital assets and CBDCs might limit domestic policy flexibility, possibly slowing the adoption of locally tailored innovations that benefit entrepreneurs and investors."
