      "Without adequate tribal representation and meaningful consultation, tribal-communities-reservations risk having their cultural and historical sites overlooked in restoration planning.",
      "Environmental regulations arising from the Task Force’s strategy might impose restrictions that small-business-owners in affected coastal-communities view as burdensome, slowing economic recovery post-crisis."
