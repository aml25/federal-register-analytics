    "potential_concerns": [
      "The increased focus on prosecuting financial fraud may lead to stronger protections and potential recovery for crime victims, small-business owners, and investors harmed by financial crimes.",
      "Enhanced enforcement efforts could result in greater legal and professional risks for corporate executives and employees of large corporations, possibly leading to job losses or reputational damage even before guilt is established.",
      "Coordinating multiple federal and state agencies may create bureaucratic delays or inconsistent application of enforcement efforts that could confuse affected businesses and investors.",
      "There is a risk that aggressive prosecution efforts intended to deter white-collar crime might inadvertently discourage legitimate business innovation or lending practices, impacting economic recovery.",
      "Outreach efforts intended to protect victim interests might not fully reach or benefit smaller and less resourced communities or minority-owned small businesses disproportionately affected by financial fraud."
