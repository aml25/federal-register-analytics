    "potential_concerns": [
      "Extending the federal coordinator's oversight might delay the transition to local recovery leadership, creating dependency among disaster-affected and coastal communities.",
      "Low-income individuals and families in the Gulf Coast could experience prolonged uncertainty if federal support does not sufficiently address long-term rebuilding needs during the extension.",
      "Continuing federal coordination without clear accountability measures may risk inefficient use of resources or duplication of efforts affecting disaster-affected communities' recovery outcomes.",
      "The extension could divert FEMA emergency management resources from other emerging disasters, potentially impacting response times in other regions."
