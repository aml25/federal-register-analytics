    "potential_concerns": [
      "The travel ban on persons determined to threaten peace or commit human rights abuses in Burundi may inadvertently restrict entry of legitimate visa holders, refugees, and asylum seekers fleeing violence, impacting their safety and rights.",
      "The blocking of property and financial transactions could limit the resources of individuals connected to destabilizing activities, but may also hinder humanitarian aid and economic support reaching vulnerable civilians in Burundi.",
      "Identification and designation processes led by the Treasury and State Departments might lack transparency and due process, raising concerns about potential wrongful inclusion of individuals who are not involved in violence or repression.",
      "The broad and indirect criteria for sanctions (e.g., association or material support) could create challenges for diaspora communities or businesses with ties to Burundi, affecting their legal and financial standing without clear evidence of wrongdoing."
