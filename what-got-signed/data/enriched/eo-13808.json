    "summary": "This executive order places new financial restrictions on Venezuela by banning U.S. persons from engaging in certain transactions related to Venezuelan government debt and oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PdVSA). The goal is to pressure the Venezuelan government due to its human rights abuses, political repression, corruption, and the ongoing humanitarian crisis.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The sanctions targeting Venezuelan government debt and PdVSA may exacerbate the humanitarian crisis affecting Venezuelan civilians by restricting government resources that could be used for basic needs.",
      "Energy sector workers tied to PdVSA and related industries may face job losses or economic hardship as a result of restricted financing and reduced international investment, negatively impacting livelihoods.",
      "Investors holding Venezuelan government bonds or PdVSA securities may suffer financial losses due to trading prohibitions, raising concerns about market stability and legal disputes.",
      "The designation of 'citizens-of-specific-countries-by-eo-designation' could unintentionally penalize broader groups of Venezuelans without distinction between government actors and the general population, increasing hardship for non-involved citizens."
