    "summary": "This executive order ends the national emergency declared against the International Criminal Court and reverses previously imposed sanctions and travel suspensions related to that emergency. It states that while the U.S. continues to oppose the ICC's claims over U.S. personnel, financial sanctions are no longer considered an effective approach.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Termination of sanctions may weaken U.S. leverage to protect military personnel abroad, potentially exposing active duty service members and veterans to future ICC jurisdictional claims despite the stated opposition.",
      "The removal of travel restrictions tied to the prior emergency could unintentionally increase risks of legal or diplomatic complications for U.S. military personnel and veterans traveling internationally where ICC influence exists.",
      "Without financial sanctions as a deterrent, the ICC and related international actors might interpret the U.S. policy shift as diminished resolve, potentially encouraging future jurisdictional pursuits against U.S. personnel that could affect military morale and legal protections."
