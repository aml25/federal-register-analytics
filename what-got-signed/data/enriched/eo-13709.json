    "potential_concerns": [
      "The award process may unintentionally exclude deserving intelligence personnel or military members due to stringent documentation or departmental concurrence requirements, limiting recognition of meritorious service.",
      "The order’s requirement for detailed documentation and verification might discourage eyewitnesses or individuals with knowledge from submitting recommendations, potentially biasing awards toward higher-ranking or well-connected personnel.",
      "Given the order’s emphasis on national security and intelligence operations, there is a risk that recipients’ identities or acts of heroism may remain classified, reducing public awareness and broader societal recognition of their contributions.",
      "Because the medal can be awarded regardless of nationality, there may be diplomatic sensitivities or concerns among foreign governments about recognizing non-U.S. individuals in sensitive national security contexts."
