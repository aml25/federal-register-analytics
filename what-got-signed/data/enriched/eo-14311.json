      "Coordination challenges between the new Office for Special Peace Missions and existing agencies like the Department of Defense could create operational inefficiencies affecting military personnel active duty and veterans.",
      "Foreign governments and citizens of conflict-affected countries might view the Office's peace efforts as intrusive or biased, potentially straining diplomatic relations.",
      "The appointment of a Special Envoy with broad powers may risk politicizing peace missions, which could undermine trust among international partners and military stakeholders.",
      "Insufficient funding or unclear jurisdictional boundaries could limit effectiveness, leading to unmet expectations for populations in conflict zones represented by 'citizens-of-specific-countries-by-eo-designation'."
