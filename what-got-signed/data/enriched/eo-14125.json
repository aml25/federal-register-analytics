    "potential_concerns": [
      "The order may prolong the labor dispute, potentially disrupting transportation services for working-age adults who rely on New Jersey transit, impacting urban and specific-state populations negatively.",
      "Union members and transportation workers could face limitations on negotiating improvements or changes in working conditions during the 120-day no-strike/no-change maintenance period, potentially causing workplace dissatisfaction.",
      "The emergency board process could delay resolution, causing unintended economic strain on urban communities dependent on reliable transit infrastructure.",
      "The freeze on changing working conditions might unintentionally entrench existing inequities or issues in labor relations, affecting both employees and commuters within New Jersey state."
