      "The Council's recommendations may favor well-established nonprofits and community groups, potentially overlooking smaller or emerging organizations, limiting equitable support.",
      "Increased emphasis on civic participation and volunteerism could unintentionally pressure college-university-students and volunteers-national-service-participants to engage beyond their capacity, risking burnout or exclusion.",
      "Cross-sector collaboration initiatives involving state-governments and local-governments may lead to bureaucratic delays or conflicts that slow down community solutions implementation.",
      "Without clear safeguards, the promotion of social innovation via social-media-platform-policy could inadvertently marginalize communities with limited digital access, reducing inclusive civic engagement."
