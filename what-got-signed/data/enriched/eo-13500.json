    "potential_concerns": [
      "Redefining senior roles to emphasize energy and climate change policy may shift focus and resources away from other critical domestic policy areas, potentially affecting renewable-energy-workers who rely on sustained policy support.",
      "Expanding the role of a Chief Technology Officer could lead to prioritizing technology initiatives that may disrupt existing technology-workers without adequate transition support.",
      "Adjustments in leadership around national service may affect volunteers-national-service-participants by changing program priorities or funding allocations, leading to uncertainty or reduced opportunities.",
      "The government reorganization under this order might cause temporary confusion or lack of coordination among agencies involved in energy, climate, and technology policies, indirectly impacting workers in these sectors."
