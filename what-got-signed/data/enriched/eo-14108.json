      "Gap periods in health monitoring or delayed recognition of long-term health effects may leave some patients without timely medical interventions or support, undermining the effectiveness of public health emergency response efforts (public-health-emergency-response, patients-general).",
      "Interagency coordination and extended federal involvement may inadvertently slow state-level disaster recovery efforts or complicate addressing unmet community needs in a timely manner (disaster-response, disaster-rebuilding-long-term-recovery, specific-state-populations)."
