    "summary": "This executive order extends the life of several existing federal advisory committees for two more years, allowing them to continue advising the government on various topics. It also delegates responsibility for overseeing these committees to the heads of their respective departments or agencies and makes certain amendments to a prior executive order related to the Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Delegation of oversight to agency heads may reduce direct presidential accountability, potentially diminishing the influence and effectiveness of advisory committees representing Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and tribal colleges.",
      "Extending the duration of advisory committees without periodic substantive review may lead to inefficiencies and stagnation, limiting input from the communities the committees aim to serve, such as individuals with disabilities and minority educational institutions.",
      "Amendments to the Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders could unintentionally dilute the representation or focus on critical issues affecting these populations if not carefully managed under revised oversight.",
      "Relying on department or agency heads for committee oversight may introduce variability in commitment or resources allocated to these advisory bodies, potentially disadvantaging marginalized groups who depend on these committees for advocacy."
