    "summary": "This executive order revokes two prior orders that required federal agencies to locate offices primarily in costly central business districts and historic properties, allowing agencies more flexibility to choose cost-effective office space where the people they serve actually are. It aims to make federal office space management more practical and efficient by permitting agencies to prioritize lower costs over strict location mandates.",

      "The regulatory changes may lead to inconsistent standards across federal office leasing and management.",
      "Stakeholders invested in prior policies may resist changes, creating implementation delays and conflicts."
