    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to promote and expand the domestic coal industry by removing regulatory barriers, supporting coal mining and exports, and accelerating coal-related technologies. It also emphasizes coal's role in national economic security, energy independence, and powering new technologies like artificial intelligence data centers.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The removal of regulatory barriers and expedited coal leasing may increase environmental pollution risks, disproportionately affecting environmental-justice-communities and urban communities near mining or power generation sites.",
      "Increased coal production and reliance on coal-powered infrastructure for AI data centers might exacerbate public health risks for children-minors living near coal mining and coal-burning facilities.",
      "While the order aims to create high-paying jobs for energy-sector-workers and union-members in rural-communities, automation and technological shifts may limit long-term employment growth, undermining intended economic benefits.",
      "Promoting coal exports and reducing environmental review processes could strain diplomatic relationships with trade partners concerned about environmental sustainability, impacting large-corporation-employees involved in export logistics and international business."
