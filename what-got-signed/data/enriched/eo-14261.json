    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to promote and expand the domestic coal industry by reducing regulatory barriers, increasing coal production and exports, and supporting coal use in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence data centers and steel manufacturing. It also updates policies to designate coal as a critical mineral and accelerate coal technology development while amending a prior executive order to incorporate coal fully in national mineral priorities.",
