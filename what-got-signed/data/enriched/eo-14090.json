      "Uniformed service members (military-personnel-active-duty) may face disparities if locality pay adjustments do not align with cost-of-living changes across different duty stations.",
      "Increasing pay rates for senior executives and political appointees might raise concerns about wage compression or perceived inequities among lower-grade federal employees.",
      "The updated schedules for foreign service officers could affect recruitment and retention if compensation does not keep pace with inflation or international comparators.",
      "Implementation complexities in adjusting pay scales simultaneously across diverse statutory pay systems could cause temporary payroll errors or delays affecting all covered populations."
