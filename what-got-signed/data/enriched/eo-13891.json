    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to improve transparency and fairness in how they issue guidance documents. It requires agencies to clearly state that such documents are non-binding, maintain public databases of these documents, and follow public notice and comment procedures for significant guidance to ensure the public is properly informed and protected from unregulated enforcement.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The requirement for agencies to clearly label guidance documents as non-binding could reduce the perceived authority of guidance, potentially creating confusion among small-business-owners about compliance obligations.",
      "Increased transparency and public notice requirements for significant guidance documents could delay agency issuance of important clarifications, adversely impacting consumers who rely on timely regulatory guidance for protection.",
      "Maintaining large, searchable databases of guidance documents may impose administrative burdens on agencies that could limit the frequency or scope of guidance updates, indirectly affecting small-business-owners who depend on current guidance.",
      "The exclusion of pre-enforcement rulings and certain enforcement-related documents from these transparency requirements could leave gaps in public awareness, particularly impacting small-business-owners seeking compliance clarity."
