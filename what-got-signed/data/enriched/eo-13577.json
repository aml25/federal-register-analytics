    "potential_concerns": [
      "The centralized promotion of investment might disproportionately favor large corporations and foreign investors over small businesses and local firms, potentially skewing benefits away from smaller players and working-age adults employed by them.",
      "Enhanced foreign investment encouragement could raise concerns related to national security and CFIUS oversight, possibly generating tension between economic growth objectives and safeguarding sensitive industries.",
      "Interagency coordination challenges might lead to bureaucratic delays or inconsistent support for investors, undermining the Initiative's goal to swiftly resolve federal issues affecting investment decisions.",
      "The Initiative's neutral stance on geographic locations may inadvertently reduce targeted support for economically distressed or rural communities, limiting equitable distribution of job creation benefits across diverse populations."
