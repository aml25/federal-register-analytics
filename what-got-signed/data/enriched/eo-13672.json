    "potential_concerns": [
      "Ensuring that anti-discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity are effectively enforced within federal contractors may be challenging, potentially leading to uneven compliance affecting LGBTQ+ individuals seeking federal contracts.",
      "Federal employees who identify as transgender or LGBTQ+ may face workplace resistance or bias despite formal protections, risking continued discrimination or harassment in practice.",
      "The requirement for the Department of Labor to issue regulations within a short timeframe could result in insufficient stakeholder engagement, leading to overly broad or unclear rules impacting federal contractors and employees.",
      "Some federal contractors might perceive the expanded nondiscrimination requirements as an administrative or compliance burden, potentially discouraging smaller contractors from seeking federal contracts."
