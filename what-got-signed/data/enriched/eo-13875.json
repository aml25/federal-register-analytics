    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to review their advisory committees to reduce their number by at least one-third, eliminating those that are obsolete, have accomplished their goals, or are costly relative to their benefit. It also limits the total number of such committees government-wide, requires agencies to report on their committees, and provides exemptions for scientific merit review panels. The order aims to improve government efficiency and ensure advisory committees serve the public interest.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The mandated reduction of federal advisory committees may disrupt scientific researchers’ ability to provide expertise, possibly weakening the quality of scientific input to federal agencies despite the merit review panel exemption.",
      "Reducing or terminating advisory committees could unintentionally diminish diverse expert perspectives, adversely impacting policy decisions that rely on broad stakeholder engagement.",
      "Limiting the total number of committees government-wide may constrain agencies’ capacity to form new advisory bodies addressing emerging or specialized issues, potentially affecting timely and effective program delivery.",
      "The criteria for termination based on cost-benefit assessments might lead to undervaluing committees with less tangible or long-term benefits, disproportionately affecting scientific or technical advisory groups."
