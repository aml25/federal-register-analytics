    "summary": "This executive order imposes a 25% tariff on all goods imported from Mexico to address serious issues related to illegal immigration and drug trafficking at the U.S. southern border. The tariffs will remain until the Mexican government takes adequate actions to control drug cartels and illegal migration that threaten U.S. national security and public health.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The 25% tariffs may raise costs for small-business-owners and consumers in border-communities, potentially harming local economies reliant on Mexican imports.",
      "Hispanic / Latino Americans and undocumented immigrants could face increased social and economic pressures or stigmatization due to the order's association of immigration with cartel activity.",
      "Law enforcement officers at federal and state/local levels might experience increased operational demands or community tensions as the order intensifies border enforcement and related conflicts.",
      "The tariffs risk provoking retaliatory trade measures from Mexico, which could exacerbate economic harm to U.S. businesses and workers reliant on cross-border trade.",
      "Unintended effects might include increased prices on goods nationwide, disproportionately impacting low- to middle-income consumers who rely on affordable Mexican-produced goods."
