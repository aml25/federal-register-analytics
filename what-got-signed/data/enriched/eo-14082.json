    "potential_concerns": [
      "The prioritization of clean energy and union-focused jobs may disadvantage energy-sector workers in oil, gas, and coal industries who may face job losses or reduced opportunities.",
      "Mandates for prevailing wages and registered apprenticeships might increase costs or limit participation for non-union workers and small businesses lacking union affiliation.",
      "Environmental justice communities and tribal communities might face challenges ensuring meaningful engagement and equitable benefit-sharing from new infrastructure projects despite the policy’s emphasis on justice.",
      "Low-income families may experience benefits from reduced energy costs, but implementation complexity or delays could slow access to affordable energy solutions.",
      "Rural communities, while targeted for economic revitalization and nature-based solutions, might experience unequal distribution of resources compared to urban areas, exacerbating regional disparities."
