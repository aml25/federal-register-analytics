    "potential_concerns": [
      "Enhanced interior immigration enforcement may lead to increased policing and detention of undocumented immigrants, disproportionately impacting Hispanic/Latino American communities, potentially undermining community trust in law enforcement.",
      "Focus on aggressive crime reduction strategies could increase tensions and unintended harm in urban, rural, and tribal communities, raising concerns over civil rights violations and potential over-policing.",
      "The Task Force's push for new legislation to address deficiencies in existing laws may result in harsher sentencing or expanded law enforcement powers that negatively affect crime victims' communities without sufficient oversight.",
      "Emphasis on drug trafficking enforcement could intensify law enforcement activities in marginalized areas, possibly leading to increased incarceration rates without concomitant investments in prevention and rehabilitation."
