    "summary": "This executive order requires federal contractors and subcontractors to pay their workers a minimum hourly wage of $15.00 starting January 30, 2022, with annual adjustments based on inflation. It also sets a schedule for tipped workers’ wages to eventually match the standard minimum wage. The order aims to improve worker productivity and efficiency in federal contracting by ensuring fair pay.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Increasing the minimum wage to $15 could raise labor costs for federal contractors, potentially leading some to reduce workforce size or limit hiring, negatively impacting working-age adults employed by these contractors.",
      "Federal contractors may pass increased labor costs onto government procurement budgets, which could reduce government efficiency or increase contracting costs.",
      "While the wage increase benefits low-income individuals directly employed by federal contractors, some small subcontractors might struggle to comply, risking contract losses or business closures.",
      "There may be uneven application and enforcement challenges across industries and geographic regions, possibly resulting in disparities for workers in rural or underrepresented communities working under federal contracts.",
      "The scheduled increases for tipped workers could cause confusion or implementation delays, affecting tipped federal contracting employees' income stability during the transition period."
