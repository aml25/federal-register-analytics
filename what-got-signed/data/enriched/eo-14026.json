    "summary": "This executive order raises the minimum hourly wage for workers employed by federal contractors to at least $15 starting in early 2022, gradually increasing it over time. It also sets specific rules for tipped workers and requires federal agencies to include these wage standards in applicable contracts to improve worker pay and productivity.",

      "Annual adjustments tied to the Consumer Price Index could introduce unpredictability for contractors budgeting long-term projects.",
      "Overlap or conflict with existing state or local minimum wage laws could complicate compliance efforts."
