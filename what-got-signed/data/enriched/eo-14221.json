      "Patients and low-income individuals may face challenges if price transparency reveals high costs but does not sufficiently improve affordability or access to care.",
      "Healthcare organizations might experience increased administrative burdens and compliance costs to meet enhanced transparency and enforcement requirements.",
      "Greater transparency in prescription-drug pricing could lead some corporations to adjust pricing strategies in ways that reduce market competition or limit drug availability.",
      "ACA marketplace enrollees and Medicaid beneficiaries could benefit from clearer pricing but might also encounter discrimination or price variability if insurers react by narrowing provider networks.",
      "Mandating actual price disclosures rather than estimates could expose data quality issues in pricing information, confusing patients and undermining trust in the system."
