    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to support and expand educational choice programs for families, including low-income, military-connected, and Native American families. It encourages states to use federal funds to help parents select the best schools for their children, such as private, faith-based, or charter schools, aiming to improve education outcomes and provide more freedom in schooling options.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The expansion of federal funds toward private, faith-based, and charter schools may divert resources away from public schools, negatively impacting public-school communities and potentially exacerbating educational inequities.",
      "Low-income families might face challenges accessing educational choice programs if there is insufficient oversight ensuring equitable distribution and transparency in scholarship or voucher allocation.",
      "Native American and tribal communities could experience uneven benefits if mechanisms for educational choice are not well adapted for Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) schools and tribal schools, risking cultural and educational mismatches.",
      "Military families may benefit from increased school choice, but implementation delays or complexity in utilizing Department of Defense funds for private or faith-based schooling could limit immediate access for active-duty personnel and military spouses.",
      "Encouraging faith-based educational options raises potential concerns about separation of church and state and ensuring that students attending such schools receive comprehensive, nondiscriminatory education in compliance with federal laws."
