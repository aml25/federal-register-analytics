    "summary": "This executive order establishes a White House Initiative to support and strengthen Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) by promoting partnerships with federal agencies, private sector, and philanthropic organizations. It also creates a Presidential Board of Advisors to provide guidance on improving educational quality, financial stability, and visibility of HBCUs, aiming to increase opportunities and success for students at these institutions.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The Initiative’s reliance on increasing private-sector and philanthropic involvement may lead to unequal resource distribution among HBCUs, potentially favoring those with stronger external connections and disadvantaging smaller or rural HBCUs.",
      "Efforts to enhance HBCUs' participation in federal programs might create additional administrative burdens for institutions with limited staff capacity, impacting HBCU students' educational experiences.",
      "Without guaranteed appropriations, the effectiveness of the Initiative and its Board of Advisors might be limited, potentially delaying meaningful improvements for African American students enrolled at HBCUs.",
      "The focus on interagency coordination and annual plans might lead to bureaucratic complexity that slows the delivery of tangible benefits to HBCU students and communities.",
      "More emphasis on public-private partnerships could shift HBCU priorities toward market-driven programs that may not fully align with the cultural and historical missions these institutions serve for African American communities."
