    "summary": "This executive order directs the Attorney General to identify and challenge state and local laws that unconstitutionally interfere with the development and use of American energy resources, especially those imposing burdensome regulations or retroactive penalties related to climate policies. It aims to ensure energy dominance and economic security by preventing states from overstepping their authority in regulating energy production and trade.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The order may exacerbate environmental harms in environmental justice communities by prioritizing energy dominance over stricter climate and pollution regulations.",
      "Low-income individuals and families in rural communities could face higher long-term health and economic burdens due to weakened state-level climate protections and potential increases in pollution.",
      "Energy sector workers and investors might benefit from expanded opportunities and reduced regulatory risk, but this could fuel tensions with states seeking local environmental control and impose legal conflicts.",
      "Restricting states' authority to regulate energy development may undermine local governance and community input, particularly in rural areas directly affected by energy extraction and infrastructure projects."
