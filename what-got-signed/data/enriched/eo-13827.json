    "summary": "This executive order prohibits U.S. persons and people within the United States from engaging in any transactions involving digital currencies issued by the Venezuelan government since January 9, 2018. It aims to block the Venezuelan government's efforts to bypass U.S. sanctions through the use of digital currencies, particularly the digital coin launched by the Maduro regime. The Treasury Secretary is authorized to enforce and implement these prohibitions without prior notice to prevent undermining the sanctions.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The prohibition on transactions involving Venezuelan government-issued digital currencies may significantly restrict cryptocurrency holders’ ability to use or trade these assets, leading to financial losses or asset freezes.",
      "Citizens of Venezuela may suffer unintended economic hardship due to restricted access to the digital currency, further exacerbating the country’s economic crisis and limiting avenues for remittances or financial transactions.",
      "The sanctions could encourage illicit or black-market digital currency transactions that evade U.S. enforcement, undermining the effectiveness of the sanctions on the Venezuelan government.",
      "U.S.-based financial institutions and cryptocurrency platforms may face compliance challenges in enforcing the order, potentially leading to over-compliance that inadvertently blocks legitimate transactions involving Venezuelan nationals or diaspora.",
      "The broad definition of 'United States person' and the prohibition on dealings within the U.S. could have ripple effects impacting Venezuelan immigrants or dual nationals in the U.S. who hold or use Venezuelan digital assets."
