      "Efforts to address trade deficits through enforcement actions may lead to retaliatory tariffs harming manufacturing workers and union members reliant on export markets.",
      "Focusing on defense-industrial-base strengthening might prioritize certain industries at the expense of broader manufacturing sectors, potentially affecting working-age adults employed outside defense-related fields.",
      "Increased scrutiny and potential sanctions against trading partners for unfair practices could disrupt supply chains, causing job insecurity among manufacturing and defense industry workers.",
      "Worker-rights-protections emphasis may lead to stricter trade barriers that, while aiming to protect U.S. jobs, could increase costs for consumers and harm overall employment growth among working-age adults."
