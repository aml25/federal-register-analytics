      "The noncompetitive hiring pathway may create perceptions of unfairness among non-AmeriCorps working-age adults seeking federal jobs, potentially affecting workforce morale and diversity.",
      "AmeriCorps alumni who are non-U.S. citizens or do not meet standard suitability criteria remain ineligible, potentially limiting the inclusiveness of the hiring exception.",
      "The reliance on AmeriCorps certification processes might lead to administrative bottlenecks or errors affecting timely appointment of qualified alumni.",
      "Extending preferential hiring only up to three years after service could disadvantage qualified volunteers whose career transitions do not align with this timeframe.",
      "Federal agencies may inadvertently favor candidates with AmeriCorps experience over others with comparable skills but different backgrounds, potentially narrowing the talent pool."
