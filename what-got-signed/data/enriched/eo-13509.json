    "potential_concerns": [
      "Coordination challenges among numerous federal agencies might delay or dilute effective support to automotive-industry-workers and impacted communities, undermining manufacturing-policy goals.",
      "Small-business-owners in automotive supply chains may face difficulties adapting to federal programs if support is unevenly distributed, potentially exacerbating economic disparities in suburban and rural-communities.",
      "Union-members and working-age adults might experience tensions if federal assistance prioritizes some regions or industries over others, raising concerns about worker-rights-protections and equitable economic-recovery-post-crisis.",
      "Increased federal outreach and intervention could unintentionally lead to bureaucratic complexity that deters low-income individuals and families from accessing needed resources.",
      "There is a risk that efforts to revitalize automotive communities might insufficiently address the unique needs of individual localities, especially urban-communities severely affected by unemployment and poverty, limiting overall effectiveness."
