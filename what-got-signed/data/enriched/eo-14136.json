    "potential_concerns": [
      "The order's delegation of acting Attorney General duties to U.S. Attorneys in specific districts could centralize power unevenly, potentially affecting federal law enforcement priorities, which may impact federal law enforcement officers' operations.",
      "Granting the President broad discretion to depart from the established order of succession might lead to politicization of the acting Attorney General role, undermining perceived impartiality in federal law enforcement.",
      "Excluding individuals serving in an acting capacity from succession eligibility could create temporary leadership gaps, possibly disrupting justice department functions relied upon by federal law enforcement officers.",
      "The revocation of the previous succession order could generate uncertainty or transition challenges that affect continuity within the Department of Justice, influencing the effectiveness of federal law enforcement operations."
