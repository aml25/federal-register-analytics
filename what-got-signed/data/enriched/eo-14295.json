      "Faster publication of regulations could reduce the time small business owners and large corporation employees have to adapt or provide input, increasing compliance challenges.",
      "Modernizing systems and cutting bureaucratic steps might inadvertently reduce transparency or oversight, potentially disadvantaging consumers who rely on regulatory protections.",
      "Adjusting publishing fees to reflect actual costs, while aiming for efficiency, may lead to higher fees that burden agencies and indirectly impact stakeholders dependent on regulatory processes.",
      "Speeding up deregulation publication risks prioritizing rapid deregulation over thorough review, possibly resulting in incomplete consideration of impacts on affected populations."
