      "Religious organizations involved in the Religious Liberty Commission might experience policy shifts that could generate controversies regarding the balance between religious freedoms and civil rights.",
      "Veterans engaging with small business development advisory committees may encounter delays or disruptions if committee functions shift authority among agencies, affecting program continuity.",
      "HBCU students and communities may see limited influence from the continued advisory council if the transferred oversight reduces direct presidential engagement and responsiveness."
