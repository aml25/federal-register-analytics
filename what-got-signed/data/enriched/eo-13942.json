      "The ban on ByteDance transactions may disrupt technology workers and large corporations involved with TikTok-related services, leading to job losses or halted innovation.",
      "College and university students and youth may be adversely affected by restricted access to a popular social media platform, impacting their communication and creative outlets.",
      "Federal employees and active-duty military personnel will benefit from enhanced cybersecurity protections, but enforcing this ban may require ongoing resources and pose challenges in compliance monitoring.",
      "The order could inadvertently incentivize the development of alternative Chinese-owned apps that evade U.S. restrictions, undermining the national security objective.",
      "Broad prohibitions may lead to over-compliance or confusion among businesses regarding what constitutes prohibited transactions, potentially causing economic inefficiencies for U.S. firms."
