    "summary": "This executive order extends the duration of the federal coordinator's role responsible for supporting the recovery and rebuilding of the Gulf Coast region following disasters. Specifically, it changes the coordinator's term from ending on February 28, 2009, to September 30, 2009, allowing additional time to continue recovery efforts.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Extending the coordinator's term may delay transitioning recovery authority back to local agencies, potentially frustrating disaster-affected communities, especially low-income families reliant on timely rebuilding.",
      "Additional federal oversight time may prolong bureaucratic processes, negatively impacting coastal communities eager for faster economic and infrastructure recovery.",
      "Resources focused on extending federal coordination through September 2009 might divert attention from immediate relief efforts for vulnerable populations in disaster-affected areas."
