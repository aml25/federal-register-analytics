    "summary": "This executive order declares English as the official language of the United States. It revokes a previous order aimed at improving access to government services for people with limited English proficiency but does not require agencies to stop offering services in other languages. The order emphasizes promoting unity and a shared culture through one official language in government operations.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Designating English as the official language could limit effective government communication with non-English-speaking populations such as Hispanic/Latino Americans, Asian Americans, refugees, and asylum seekers, undermining citizenship-policy goals related to inclusion and civic engagement.",
      "Revoking protections and guidance under Executive Order 13166 may unintentionally reduce access to vital services for limited English proficiency individuals, creating administrative barriers and decreased government efficiency in serving diverse communities.",
      "Emphasizing one shared language for cultural unity may marginalize multilingual American communities and those maintaining heritage languages, potentially eroding cultural diversity and alienating naturalized citizens and immigrant populations.",
      "Without mandated discontinuation but removal of prior guidance, agency heads may inconsistently provide multilingual services, resulting in uneven access for vulnerable populations, particularly undocumented immigrants and refugees who rely on non-English materials for critical services."
