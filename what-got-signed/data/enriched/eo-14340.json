    "summary": "This executive order directs federal law enforcement and agencies to end the practice of releasing criminal suspects in Washington, D.C. without cash bail, especially those considered dangerous. It aims to hold such suspects in custody before trial to improve public safety in response to a declared crime emergency in the District of Columbia.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The order may lead to increased pretrial detention for low-income individuals and defendants accused of crimes, exacerbating existing inequalities in the criminal justice system despite criminal-justice-reform concerns.",
      "Expanded federal law enforcement custody and prosecution could strain relations with the District of Columbia local government and complicate state-local-law-enforcement-support efforts.",
      "Increased pretrial detention risks harsher conditions and barriers to reentry for formerly-incarcerated returning citizens, potentially increasing recidivism.",
      "While aiming to enhance public safety for crime victims and federal employees, the order risks undermining constitutional protections for accused persons by limiting bail options.",
      "Implementation pressures on the Metropolitan Police Department policies might result in operational confusion or enforcement disparities impacting defendants disproportionately."
