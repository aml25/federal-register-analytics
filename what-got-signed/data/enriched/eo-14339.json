    "potential_concerns": [
      "Increased militarization and deployment of National Guard units may strain military readiness and raise civil rights concerns for urban communities, including renters and low-income families in the District of Columbia.",
      "The order's enforcement and housing compliance investigations could lead to heightened scrutiny and possible evictions of low-income tenants, potentially worsening housing instability for vulnerable populations.",
      "Rapid hiring and deployment of specialized law enforcement units might outpace proper community engagement and training, risking escalated conflicts or mistrust between law enforcement officers and local residents.",
      "Expanded prosecutorial focus on violent and property crimes could disproportionately affect marginalized groups, potentially increasing incarceration rates without addressing underlying social factors.",
      "Investigations and enforcement actions intended to improve transit worker safety may disrupt public transit services, impacting working-age adults and other transit-dependent populations in the District."
