    "summary": "This executive order formally ends the national emergency related to the risk of nuclear proliferation due to the large stockpile of weapons-usable fissile material in Russia. It recognizes that successful agreements between the U.S. and Russia have significantly reduced this risk, and it revokes the previous order that declared the emergency.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Terminating the emergency may reduce ongoing vigilance and resources dedicated to monitoring weapons-usable fissile material, potentially increasing proliferation risks that could impact veterans and military personnel tasked with national security.",
      "Foreign governments, particularly U.S. allies, may view the termination as a premature easing of pressure on Russia, raising concerns about international arms control stability.",
      "The order’s revocation of prior restrictions may unintentionally embolden Russia or other actors to relax compliance, which could negatively affect global nonproliferation efforts and U.S. military strategic interests.",
      "Veterans and active-duty military personnel might be indirectly affected if the shift in policy reduces funding or operational readiness connected to nuclear threat mitigation."
