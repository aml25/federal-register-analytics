    "potential_concerns": [
      "Ending COVID-19 vaccine mandates in schools may increase the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks among children-minors and youth-young-adults, negatively impacting public health and educational continuity in public-school-communities and higher education institutions.",
      "This order's emphasis on parental authority and religious freedom could lead to conflict with existing public health policies and create challenges in accommodating individuals with disabilities or chronic illnesses in school settings.",
      "Faith-based communities may support the order’s reinforcement of religious liberty, but public-school and higher education institutions might face funding risks if compliance with vaccine mandates is seen as coercive, threatening educational access.",
      "Removing federal funding from schools that enforce vaccine mandates could disproportionately harm public-school-communities by limiting resources, potentially reducing educational quality or access for k-12-students and college-university-students.",
      "The policy may unintentionally encourage vaccine misinformation among parents and young adults by emphasizing 'accurate data' on low risks without balancing the benefits of vaccination, potentially undermining broader vaccine-policy goals."
