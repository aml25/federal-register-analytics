    "potential_concerns": [
      "Implementation of protections for LGBTQ+ and transgender students could lead to conflicts with religious or cultural beliefs within some public, private, and charter school communities, raising concerns around accommodation and potential legal challenges.",
      "Schools may face increased administrative and resource burdens in updating policies, training staff, and enforcing non-discrimination provisions, potentially straining smaller or underfunded educational institutions.",
      "There is a risk that efforts to protect students from sex discrimination could lead to disputes over fairness in gender-specific spaces or athletics, impacting both transgender and cisgender students.",
      "Ensuring consistent and equitable enforcement across diverse educational settings may be difficult, which could result in uneven protections and support for students, particularly those identifying as LGBTQ+ or transgender.",
      "Heightened focus on sexual harassment and discrimination policies might inadvertently create adversarial environments or legal uncertainties for educators and administrators within affected school communities."
