    "summary": "This executive order pauses the planned tariffs on Canadian goods that were intended to address illegal migration and drug trafficking issues at the U.S.-Canada border. It directs U.S. officials to continue monitoring the situation and states that if conditions worsen, the tariffs will be implemented immediately.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Pausing tariffs may reduce immediate economic pressure on Canadian businesses and their U.S. trading partners, potentially prolonging challenges faced by border communities reliant on cross-border trade.",
      "If the Government of Canada fails to sufficiently address drug trafficking and illegal migration, border communities and law enforcement could face worsening security and public safety risks.",
      "The possibility of sudden tariff implementation after March 4, 2025 may create economic uncertainty for small business owners and large corporation employees engaged in cross-border commerce, leading to disrupted supply chains.",
      "This executive order’s reliance on bilateral cooperation without clear benchmarks may complicate accountability and delay effective resolution of illicit trafficking impacting border security."
