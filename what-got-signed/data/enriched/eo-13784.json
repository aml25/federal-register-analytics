      "Focus on opioid addiction could inadvertently neglect individuals-with-mental-health-conditions who require integrated care approaches, limiting comprehensive treatment effectiveness.",
      "Patients-general might experience delays or restricted access to pain management if prescription guidelines become overly stringent as part of combating opioid abuse."
