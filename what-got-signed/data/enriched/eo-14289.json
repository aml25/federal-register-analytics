    "summary": "This executive order prevents multiple overlapping tariffs from stacking on the same imported goods to avoid excessive duty rates that go beyond policy goals. It establishes rules for which tariffs apply when articles are covered by multiple tariffs and directs agencies to update regulations and the tariff schedule accordingly, applying changes retroactively to imports from March 4, 2025.",

      "Retroactive tariff adjustments may create administrative complexities and disputes over refunds for importers.",
      "Small importers and international shippers could face increased compliance burdens due to changes in tariff application and enforcement.",
      "The non-stacking rules might reduce tariff revenues and potentially weaken leverage in trade or security-related negotiations.",
      "Complex coordination among multiple agencies to update systems and guidance within a short timeframe could lead to inconsistent application.",
      "The order may create confusion about how tariffs interact with others not listed, possibly causing legal or enforcement ambiguities."
