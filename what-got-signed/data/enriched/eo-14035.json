    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) across the federal workforce by setting standards, collecting and analyzing workforce data, improving recruitment and retention of underserved communities, providing training, and removing barriers related to disabilities and LGBTQ+ inclusion. It establishes government-wide and agency-specific strategic plans, enhances paid internship opportunities, encourages partnerships with diverse educational and community organizations, and addresses pay equity and employment opportunities for formerly incarcerated individuals.",
