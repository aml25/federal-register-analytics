    "potential_concerns": [
      "The focus on expanding hiring and advancement opportunities for underserved populations, including formerly incarcerated individuals and individuals with disabilities, might cause concerns about perceptions of lowered meritocratic standards among some federal employees or applicants.",
      "Implementation of non-binary and transgender-inclusive workplace policies may cause resistance or administrative challenges within agencies unprepared for updating identity systems and facilities, potentially leading to confusion or delays for transgender and non-binary federal employees.",
      "The increased data collection of voluntarily self-reported demographic information raises potential privacy concerns for employees, especially LGBTQ+ individuals and those with disabilities, if confidentiality protections are inadequate or inconsistently applied.",
      "Efforts to eliminate pay inequities by restricting reliance on salary history may unintentionally burden agencies with increased complexity in salary determination, potentially delaying or complicating hiring and promotion decisions that affect federal employees.",
      "Expanding paid internship opportunities and outreach to underserved communities could unintentionally reduce opportunities for unpaid internships that some agencies rely on, potentially straining agency resources or limiting placement capacity."
