    "summary": "This executive order expands U.S. sanctions against Russia by targeting foreign financial institutions involved with Russia's military-industrial sectors and restricting imports of Russian goods such as seafood, diamonds, and alcoholic beverages. It strengthens measures to hinder Russia's access to international financial systems and closes loopholes in trade and financial transactions to further pressure Russia amid national security concerns.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The expanded sanctions on foreign financial institutions involved with Russia’s military-industrial base may disrupt global financial markets and complicate compliance for financial services workers operating internationally.",
      "The import bans on Russian seafood, diamonds, and alcoholic beverages could lead to economic hardship and job losses for seafood fishery workers and related businesses dependent on trade with Russia or Russian-origin products.",
      "Restrictive measures against corporations doing business in or with Russia might strain U.S. and allied multinational companies, affecting corporate balance sheets and possibly leading to litigation or diplomatic tensions with foreign governments.",
      "The aggressive financial restrictions may push Russia and affected foreign financial institutions to seek alternative financial systems, potentially undermining long-term U.S. influence in international finance.",
      "There is a risk that enforcement complexities around tracing goods partially sourced or manufactured in Russia could create disputes and compliance burdens for customs and trade sectors, indirectly impacting shipping and transportation workers."
