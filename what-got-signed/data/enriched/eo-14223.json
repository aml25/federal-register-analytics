    "summary": "This executive order directs the Secretary of Commerce to investigate whether imports of timber, lumber, and related products pose a threat to U.S. national security due to unfair trade practices and supply vulnerabilities. It requires a report with findings and recommendations for actions like tariffs or incentives to strengthen domestic production and secure the supply chain for both civilian and military use.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Tariffs or quotas imposed on timber and lumber imports may increase costs for corporations and construction workers relying on imported wood, potentially slowing construction projects and affecting economic growth.",
      "Actions to restrict imports could provoke retaliatory trade measures from foreign governments, disrupting supply chains and negatively impacting manufacturing and defense industry workers dependent on timely material availability.",
      "Efforts to expand domestic timber and lumber production might strain natural resources and rural communities if environmental impacts and sustainable practices are not properly balanced.",
      "Veterans and active military personnel could face delays or limitations in accessing innovative wood-based building materials if domestic production capacity does not rapidly meet military procurement needs.",
      "Foreign nationals working in timber exporting countries may experience economic repercussions due to decreased demand from the U.S. market resulting from tariffs or trade restrictions."
