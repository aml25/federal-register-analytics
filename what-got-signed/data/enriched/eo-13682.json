It also clarifies how pay and leave should be handled for that day and directs the Office of Personnel Management to implement the order.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The order’s exception for employees deemed essential for national security or defense may lead to inconsistent application across agencies, causing confusion and potential morale issues among federal employees required to work on December 26.",
      "Federal employees excused from duty but still compensated may raise concerns about equitable pay policies and leave accrual under EO 11582 and related statutes.",
      "Limited guidance on what constitutes 'other public need' may result in discretionary and uneven determinations by agency heads, potentially creating perceptions of unfair treatment among federal employees.",
      "Employees working on the closed day may face challenges balancing personal time with work obligations, possibly impacting job satisfaction and work-life balance."
