    "summary": "This executive order updates membership rules for the President's Export Council by specifying various government departments and organizations that should be represented. It also assigns the Department of Energy responsibility for providing funding, administrative, and technical support to the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) and for managing certain functions under the Federal Advisory Committee Act related to PCAST.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Expanding membership representation on the President's Export Council could dilute the influence of small business owners and agricultural interests amid larger corporate voices.",
      "Assigning the Department of Energy responsibility for PCAST funding and FACA functions may create bureaucratic bottlenecks that delay science and technology advisory outputs impacting scientific researchers.",
      "Requiring the Department of Energy to manage administrative support for PCAST could strain department resources, potentially reducing effectiveness of innovation advising to federal agencies and industries.",
      "The composition changes to the Export Council might inadvertently prioritize export-import policy over labor or environmental concerns, affecting workers and environmental justice communities indirectly but meaningfully."
