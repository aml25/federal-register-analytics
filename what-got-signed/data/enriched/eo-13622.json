    "summary": "This executive order authorizes the U.S. government to impose additional sanctions on foreign financial institutions and persons engaging in significant transactions involving Iran's petroleum and petrochemical sectors. It aims to prevent Iran from using revenues from these sectors for illicit purposes and to restrict its ability to evade international sanctions, thereby protecting the international financial system and pressuring the Iranian government.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The sanctions may significantly disrupt foreign financial institutions and corporations engaged with Iranian petroleum and petrochemical sectors, risking large financial losses and operational limitations.",
      "Energy sector workers, particularly in oil and gas industries tied to Iranian trade, could experience job instability and reduced business opportunities due to decreased transactions and sanctions enforcement.",
      "Foreign nationals working within or dependent on affected Iranian-linked companies might face increased financial hardship or legal risks as a result of the expanded sanctions regime.",
      "The order's broad definition of sanctioned persons and entities could inadvertently impact international banks and businesses with indirect ties to Iran, raising compliance complexities and potential overreach.",
      "Restricting financial transactions may cause some foreign financial institutions to sever relations broadly with Iranian-linked entities, limiting lawful economic activity and potentially exacerbating humanitarian impacts in Iran."
