    "potential_concerns": [
      "The commission's focus on increasing law enforcement capabilities may lead to expanded policing practices that disproportionately impact tribal and urban communities, raising concerns about potential over-policing and civil rights infringements.",
      "Efforts to address recruitment and retention in rural and tribal law enforcement might unintentionally divert resources from community-based violence prevention programs that could benefit urban populations.",
      "Recommendations emphasizing deterrence and enforcement could overshadow investments in social services and mental health supports, which are critical for individuals affected by social factors such as homelessness and substance abuse.",
      "Without explicit safeguards, the study and recommendations might insufficiently address systemic biases affecting crime victims from marginalized communities, limiting improvements in victim support services.",
      "The commission’s reliance on input from law enforcement perspectives risks underrepresenting the experiences of crime victims and marginalized community members, potentially biasing policy recommendations."
