      "Streamlining and accelerating regulatory reviews may compromise thorough safety and quality inspections, potentially putting patients-general at risk.",
      "Efforts to expedite domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing might disproportionately benefit manufacturing-workers and defense-industry-workers, while smaller manufacturers or startups may struggle to keep pace, raising concerns about market competition and healthcare-competition-markets.",
      "Reducing inspection frequency or modifying risk-based inspection protocols could create gaps that foreign firms might exploit, potentially weakening overall supply-chain-security.",
      "Centralizing and expediting environmental permitting processes may lead to insufficient environmental review, raising risks to local communities near manufacturing facilities and potential environmental-justice concerns not directly addressed in this order."
