    "potential_concerns": [
      "The requirement to offset increases in mandatory spending may lead agencies to reduce benefits or eligibility for Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security beneficiaries, negatively impacting low-income individuals and families who rely heavily on these programs.",
      "Reinvigorating Administrative PAYGO could slow down the implementation of beneficial regulatory reforms or guidance due to budget offset constraints, potentially harming vulnerable populations dependent on timely administrative actions.",
      "The discretion granted to the OMB Director to determine acceptable offsets might result in inconsistent application across agencies, creating uncertainty for populations reliant on mandatory spending programs.",
      "Efforts to curtail costly administrative actions may limit agencies' flexibility in addressing emergent public needs affecting low-income and elderly populations, leading to unintended reductions in service quality or availability."
