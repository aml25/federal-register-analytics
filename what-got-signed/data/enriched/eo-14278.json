      "The emphasis on integrating Artificial Intelligence for upskilling may disadvantage individuals-with-disabilities if adequate accessibility accommodations are not implemented.",
      "Expanding Registered Apprenticeships primarily in high-growth sectors might leave behind workers in declining industries or rural-communities due to geographic or industry mismatch.",
      "The focus on alternative credentials over traditional four-year degrees could create confusion or legitimacy concerns among working-age-adults seeking recognition for their skills.",
      "Streamlining and consolidating programs might unintentionally eliminate some workforce development initiatives that currently serve niche or vulnerable populations effectively."
