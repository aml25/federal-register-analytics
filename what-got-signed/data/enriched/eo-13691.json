      "The voluntary sharing of cybersecurity threat information by corporations and nonprofit organizations may expose consumer data to privacy risks despite nominal protections, potentially affecting individuals with disabilities who rely on accessible digital services.",
      "Automated information sharing mechanisms encouraged by the Executive Order might unintentionally lead to overcollection or misuse of sensitive personal information, raising concerns under data-privacy and civil liberties themes for consumers.",
      "Technology workers and cybersecurity professionals could face increased pressure to rapidly share sensitive threat data, which may create operational and ethical challenges balancing national security and individual privacy interests.",
      "The collaboration between private sector ISAOs and federal agencies under homeland-security and critical-infrastructure-protection objectives risks mission creep that could infringe on civil liberties of consumers if oversight and transparency are insufficient."
