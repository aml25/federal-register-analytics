    "potential_concerns": [
      "The order's directive to remove 'ideological or divisive narratives' from museums and historical sites may marginalize African Americans, Native Americans, women, and LGBTQ+ individuals by erasing or minimizing their historical experiences and contributions.",
      "Teachers and educators may face challenges in delivering comprehensive history education if curricula and museum exhibits are restricted to only 'positive and unified' narratives, potentially undermining educational integrity.",
      "By mandating a celebration of a narrowly defined 'American greatness' and excluding recognition of transgender athletes or complex racial histories, the order risks alienating diverse communities and promoting exclusionary views of American identity.",
      "Restoration and reinstatement of pre-existing monuments could reignite social and cultural conflicts, especially in communities where certain monuments have been removed due to their controversial nature.",
      "Museum and cultural institution staff and nonprofit organizations may experience operational and reputational impacts from budgetary and ideological restrictions imposed by the order."
