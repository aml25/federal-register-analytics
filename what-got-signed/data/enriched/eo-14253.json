    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to prevent ideological or divisive narratives in the presentation of American history at national museums and monuments, especially the Smithsonian Institution and Independence National Historical Park. It calls for restoring historical displays and public sites to emphasize national pride, traditional interpretations of American accomplishments, and removes content deemed divisive or critical of the nation’s founding and values.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The order’s directive to remove content considered divisive may suppress legitimate historical scholarship and present an overly sanitized or one-sided view of history.",
      "Implementation could politicize federally managed museums and public sites, undermining their educational mission and alienating diverse visitors and scholars.",
      "Pressure to remove current exhibits or training programs may lead to legal challenges regarding academic freedom and First Amendment protections.",
      "The order’s language targeting certain ideological perspectives may deepen cultural and political divisions rather than promote unity.",
      "Ambiguity in definitions of “improper ideology” risks inconsistent enforcement and potential censorship of critical engagement with complex historical issues."
