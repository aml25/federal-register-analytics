    "summary": "This executive order aims to improve public safety and criminal justice for Native American communities by coordinating federal efforts to prevent and respond to violence against Native Americans, including cases of missing or murdered indigenous people. It directs agencies to enhance law enforcement coordination, support Tribal law enforcement and victim services, improve data collection and information sharing, and develop prevention and intervention strategies in collaboration with Tribal Nations and urban Native organizations.",

    "potential_concerns": [
      "The emphasis on expanded law enforcement jurisdiction and prosecution in Tribal communities may raise concerns about tribal sovereignty and the adequacy of resources for Tribal governments to comply with new mandates, potentially impacting native-americans-indigenous-peoples and tribal-communities-reservations.",
      "Improved data collection efforts, while critical, might result in privacy concerns or misuse of sensitive information about indigenous victims, especially affecting native-americans-indigenous-peoples and missing-murdered-indigenous-persons.",
      "Efforts to coordinate federal, state, local, and Tribal law enforcement might create jurisdictional confusion or duplication that delays justice for domestic-violence-survivors and human-trafficking-victims within urban-communities.",
      "The focus on culturally and linguistically appropriate victim services must ensure meaningful inclusion of lgbtq-individuals and women to avoid leaving marginalized groups within native-americans-indigenous-peoples underserved.",
      "Increased federal involvement in tribal criminal cases could unintentionally sideline Tribal legal traditions or community-based conflict resolution approaches, potentially impacting tribal-communities-reservations and their autonomy."
