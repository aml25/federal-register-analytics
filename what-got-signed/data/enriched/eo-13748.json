    "potential_concerns": [
      "Coordinating federal investments across diverse agencies may lead to bureaucratic delays that slow timely support to low-income and tribal communities facing urgent housing and infrastructure needs.",
      "Without strong safeguards, community-driven initiatives might inadvertently privilege better-resourced urban or suburban communities over persistently impoverished rural and tribal areas, exacerbating inequities.",
      "Aligning federal programs under a centralized council risks limiting local autonomy for indigenous and environmental justice communities if their unique priorities are overshadowed by broad federal agendas.",
      "The emphasis on data-driven practices may unintentionally exclude marginalized populations lacking robust data representation, such as Native American tribes and environmental justice communities, from receiving appropriate resources.",
      "Efforts to foster collaboration among numerous federal entities might unintentionally divert attention and resources from direct community-level investments, reducing the immediate impact on individuals experiencing poverty."
