    "potential_concerns": [
      "Enhanced privileges and immunities granted to INTERPOL may complicate oversight and accountability of law enforcement activities by federal officers within U.S. jurisdiction.",
      "The expanded diplomatic immunities could create tensions with foreign governments and officials if perceived as preferential treatment or interference in sovereignty.",
      "Granting broader immunities to INTERPOL might risk undermining domestic legal processes, potentially impacting crime victims and accused persons indirectly through international policing actions.",
      "Increased cooperation under the amended order may raise concerns about data sharing and privacy protections for U.S. citizens handled by an international body."
