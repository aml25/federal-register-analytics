It aims to increase economic pressure on the Russian government in response to ongoing aggression. The order also forbids actions that try to evade these restrictions and allows the U.S. government to enforce and regulate these prohibitions.",

      "The export ban on luxury goods and U.S. dollar banknotes to Russia may have limited direct positive impact but could complicate compliance for U.S. exporters, increasing legal risk for corporations and investors.",
      "Evasion and circumvention enforcement measures may impose heightened compliance costs and penalties on U.S. businesses engaging in international trade, potentially reducing competitiveness and operational flexibility."
