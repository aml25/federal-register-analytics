    "potential_concerns": [
      "The focus on industry-recognized credentials and demand-driven training may unintentionally marginalize smaller educational institutions and limit educational diversity impacting youth-young-adults and working-age-adults.",
      "There may be challenges ensuring equitable access to skills training for labor-union members and small-business employees who might lack resources or face barriers to participate in online and apprenticeship programs.",
      "Efforts to promote employer-led training initiatives could disproportionately favor large corporations over small-business-owners, potentially exacerbating disparities in workforce development opportunities.",
      "Without strong oversight, the initiative’s endorsement of certain private sector training models risks prioritizing employer needs over worker protections and fair labor standards, affecting union-members and working-age-adults.",
      "Increased transparency and reliance on job market data might lead to overemphasis on measurable skills while undervaluing foundational education or soft skills important for long-term career adaptability."
