    "potential_concerns": [
      "The prioritization of recruiting top private sector design talent under the America by Design initiative may exacerbate competition for technology workers, impacting federal hiring and workforce dynamics.",
      "Efforts to implement standardized and modernized design across federal agencies could unintentionally create accessibility barriers or usability issues for individuals with disabilities or less tech-savvy working-age adults if not carefully tested.",
      "The establishment of a temporary National Design Studio organization might lead to fragmentation or duplication of efforts without clear long-term funding and authority, risking inefficient use of resources intended to improve government IT modernization.",
      "Heads of agencies may face challenges meeting the tight timeline for initial results by July 4, 2026, potentially delaying benefits to consumers relying on critical federal websites and physical services."
