      "The modification and imposition of reciprocal tariffs may raise costs for consumers by increasing prices on imported goods, negatively impacting household budgets.",
      "Changes in tariffs could disrupt supply chains and increase production costs for large corporations reliant on imported intermediate goods, potentially leading to layoffs affecting large-corporation-employees.",
      "Small business owners who rely on imported goods might face higher input costs and uncertain trade conditions, reducing their competitiveness and profitability.",
      "While aiming to strengthen the defense industrial base, tariff adjustments could cause short-term disruptions in defense industry manufacturing, affecting defense-industry-workers through production delays or employment instability.",
      "The delegation of authority to implement tariff changes might lead to inconsistent or unpredictable application of trade policies, creating uncertainty for manufacturing-workers and businesses dependent on stable trade relations."
