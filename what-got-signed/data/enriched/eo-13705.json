      "The designation may increase U.S. financial contributions or commitments to IRENA that impact renewable-energy-workers indirectly through shifting federal budget priorities.",
      "Recognition of IRENA as an international organization could raise concerns about U.S. sovereignty or influence on international renewable energy policies affecting domestic energy sector workers.",
      "The privileges and immunities granted to IRENA may complicate oversight or accountability mechanisms, potentially impacting the transparency of how U.S. interests and renewable energy goals are pursued internationally.",
      "Some domestic fossil fuel energy-sector-workers may face unintended economic pressures if the U.S. prioritizes renewable energy through international commitments connected to this designation."
