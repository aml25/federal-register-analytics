    "potential_concerns": [
      "This order's emphasis on loyalty and discipline may undermine merit-based civil service protections, negatively impacting foreign-service officers and civil servants by increasing vulnerability to politically motivated personnel actions.",
      "Reforms directed by this order could create a workplace culture that discourages dissent or independent judgment among Foreign Service personnel, potentially reducing effectiveness and morale.",
      "Political appointees may gain disproportionate influence over personnel decisions, which could politicize the Department of State’s workforce and impair institutional neutrality.",
      "The extensive discretion given to the Secretary of State risks inconsistent or opaque application of personnel policies, limiting due process protections for Foreign Service and Civil Service employees.",
      "Efforts to reform recruitment, evaluation, and retention focused on loyalty may reduce diversity and professional expertise within the Foreign Service, weakening long-term diplomatic capacity."
