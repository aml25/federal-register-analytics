    "potential_concerns": [
      "Increased solicitation in the workplace may pressure federal employees and military personnel to contribute or volunteer, potentially affecting workplace morale and perceptions of voluntariness.",
      "The inclusion of faith-based organizations in eligible recipients may raise concerns among secular and non-religious federal employees about the neutrality and inclusivity of the Combined Federal Campaign.",
      "Allowing annuitants to contribute via allotments from federal annuities could complicate annuity payment administration and raise confidentiality or privacy issues for retirees.",
      "Ensuring transparent and equitable management of funds requires robust oversight; failure could lead to favoritism or misallocation impacting the trust of federal employees and veterans in the campaign."
