      "Ambiguities in the order of succession among certain positions, particularly State Executive Directors, may cause delays or disputes during transition.",
      "Excluding acting officials from succession could limit the pool of available qualified personnel in emergencies, potentially impairing continuity.",
      "The President’s discretionary power to bypass the established succession order may cause uncertainty or perceived politicization in leadership appointments.",
      "Administrative challenges in implementing the succession order consistently across varied departmental offices could hamper smooth transitions.",
      "Revoking the prior order without clear differences or rationale might create confusion about changes in succession protocol among Department staff."
