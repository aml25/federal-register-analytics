      "The order-of-succession may create ambiguity or delays in leadership during a crisis, potentially impacting rural communities and agricultural-workers who rely on stable Department of Agriculture guidance.",
      "The inclusion of State Executive Directors from specific Midwestern states (Kansas, Missouri, Iowa) in the line of succession may raise concerns about regional bias affecting national agricultural policy and rural development priorities.",
      "Restrictions preventing acting officials serving in an acting capacity from becoming Acting Secretary could limit leadership options during an emergency, possibly disrupting government efficiency within the Department of Agriculture.",
      "The President's discretionary authority to deviate from the established succession order could lead to concerns about transparency and politicization affecting stakeholders in agricultural policy and rural development."
