      "The prioritization of global health security efforts may shift resources away from domestic public health issues impacting border communities, potentially leaving them vulnerable to infectious disease threats.",
      "International aid recipients could face increased conditionalities or oversight tied to GHSA targets, which might strain local health systems or governance structures.",
      "Interagency coordination complexities may slow rapid response times, risking delayed aid or containment efforts that directly affect global health populations.",
      "The close collaboration with international organizations like WHO may generate political or sovereignty concerns in partner countries, potentially limiting effective implementation or cooperation."
