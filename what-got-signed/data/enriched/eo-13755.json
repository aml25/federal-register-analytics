    "potential_concerns": [
      "The order of succession could create uncertainty or instability among federal employees and political appointees if it results in frequent leadership changes during critical periods.",
      "Excluding individuals serving in acting capacities from succession may limit experienced interim leaders from stepping into key roles, potentially impacting departmental continuity.",
      "Presidential discretion to depart from the established order might lead to perceptions of politicization or favoritism, affecting morale among career civil servants.",
      "Lack of clarity about eligibility under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act could cause confusion about who can lawfully serve as Acting Secretary, impacting operational effectiveness."
