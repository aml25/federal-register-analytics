      "Negotiation and price caps on prescription drugs may lead some pharmaceutical corporations to reduce innovation or limit availability of certain high-cost medications, indirectly impacting Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries relying on those therapies.",
      "Medicaid beneficiaries might face variation in drug access depending on state-level implementation and the models tested by HHS, potentially leading to disparities in prescription affordability.",
      "Low-income individuals and those with chronic illnesses could experience challenges if new payment or delivery models complicate provider networks or drug formularies, possibly restricting their current options.",
      "Pharmaceutical companies may increase prices for non-covered drugs or shift costs to private insurance markets, indirectly affecting overall drug pricing and access beyond Medicare and Medicaid populations."
