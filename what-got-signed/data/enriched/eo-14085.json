    "summary": "This executive order updates several previous orders to expand eligibility for certain U.S. military awards and decorations to include members of the U.S. Space Force and to modernize language regarding those eligible.

    "potential_concerns": [
      "Expanding eligibility for military decorations to Space Force personnel may require additional training and coordination among award-approving authorities to maintain consistent standards across all branches, potentially complicating delegation of authority.",
      "Updates to award eligibility criteria could create perceptions of unequal recognition among veterans and active-duty members from older cohorts or different branches, possibly affecting morale within military-personnel-active-duty and veterans groups.",
      "The inclusion of the Space Force in existing award frameworks may lead to temporary administrative delays or confusion impacting military readiness and timely recognition of service for military-personnel-active-duty and reservists.",
      "Delegation of authority changes must be clearly communicated and standardized to prevent bottlenecks or uneven application of awards, which could inadvertently disadvantage reservists or guard members seeking recognition."
