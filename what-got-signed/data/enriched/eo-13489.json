    "summary": "This executive order establishes how the National Archives must handle Presidential records, especially when determining whether to release them or assert executive privilege to keep them confidential. It sets procedures for notifying current and former Presidents about records disclosure and clarifies how claims of executive privilege are reviewed and acted upon. It also revokes an earlier executive order on similar matters.",

      "The executive order's process for adjudicating executive privilege claims may limit transparency, impeding access to presidential records by researchers and the public.",
      "Ambiguity in the Archivist's discretion and the role of incumbent Presidents in overruling former Presidents' privilege claims could lead to politicization of record release decisions affecting accountability.",
      "The revocation of the previous Executive Order 13233 may introduce uncertainty about the scope and criteria for executive privilege, potentially resulting in inconsistent handling of sensitive records over time.",
      "Former Presidents may face challenges protecting their confidentiality interests without clear, enforceable procedural protections, raising concerns about equitable treatment between incumbent and former leaders."
