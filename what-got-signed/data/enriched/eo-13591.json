    "potential_concerns": [
      "Continued operation of federal advisory committees may lead to inefficient allocation of resources if some committees do not provide actionable outcomes benefiting veterans and small-business owners directly.",
      "Overseeing advisory committees by agency heads could result in inconsistent prioritization of issues important to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCU) communities and individuals with disabilities, potentially diluting their influence.",
      "Extension of these advisory committees may delay necessary restructuring or termination decisions, limiting opportunities for fresh perspectives that could better address evolving needs of small-business owners and bioethics stakeholders.",
      "The continuation of labor-management relations advisory bodies may unintentionally sideline direct input from affected labor groups, such as union members or individuals with disabilities, reducing effectiveness of recommendations."
