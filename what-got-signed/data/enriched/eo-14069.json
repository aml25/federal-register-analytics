    "summary": "This executive order directs federal agencies to promote fairness in pay practices among federal contractors by encouraging rules that improve pay equity and transparency. It aims to eliminate discriminatory pay practices that harm efficiency in federal contracting and may restrict contractors from using salary history in employment decisions. The order supports efforts to make federal procurement more equitable and effective.",

      "Some stakeholders may argue the order interferes with established contracting practices or employer autonomy."
