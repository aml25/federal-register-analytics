      "Enhanced pay transparency requirements might increase administrative burdens and compliance costs for federal contractors, impacting contractor competitiveness.",
      "While promoting pay equity benefits federal employees and contractor workers, there is a risk that contractors could restrict wage offers to avoid pay disparities, possibly disadvantaging certain employees.",
      "Implementation inconsistencies across agencies and contractors could lead to uneven protections and effectiveness for workers, undermining the goal of pay-equity and transparency."
