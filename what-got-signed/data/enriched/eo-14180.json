    "potential_concerns": [
      "The Council's focus on alleged political bias and resource diversion toward undocumented immigrants may lead to reduced federal support and delayed disaster aid for undocumented immigrant communities during emergencies.",
      "Efforts to reassert State control over disaster response may create inconsistencies in aid and preparedness across state and local governments, potentially disadvantaging vulnerable disaster-affected communities without robust local capacity.",
      "The review process and public scrutiny might slow down FEMA's immediate disaster response capability, negatively impacting disaster-affected communities in urgent need of timely aid and services.",
      "The emphasis on reducing FEMA’s broader mission scope might undercut resources available for large-scale or complex disaster responses, affecting coordination with tribal governments and their disaster-affected constituents."
