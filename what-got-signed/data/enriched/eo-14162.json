      "The withdrawal from the Paris Agreement may lead to increased economic opportunities and job growth for energy sector workers in oil, gas, and coal industries, potentially boosting prosperity among large corporation employees in these sectors.",
      "Renewable energy workers could face reduced investment and job losses due to the revocation of international climate finance and deprioritization of global climate commitments.",
      "Environmental justice communities and tribal communities may suffer from increased pollution and slowed progress on greenhouse gas emission reductions, exacerbating existing health and environmental disparities.",
      "Prioritizing short-term economic growth over international climate cooperation could isolate the United States diplomatically, harming U.S. leadership and effectiveness in future global environmental initiatives."
