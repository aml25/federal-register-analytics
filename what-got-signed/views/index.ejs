        <p class="wa-body-m"><em>What Got Signed?</em> helps you see what a president has signed, without digging through dense government documents. The site tracks <a href="https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/about.html">executive orders</a> as they’re issued, explains what they do in plain language, and groups them by theme so it’s easier to see what’s changing and who it may affect. Executive orders are written instructions from the president to federal agencies that carry out existing laws under authority granted by the Constitution or Congress.</p>
