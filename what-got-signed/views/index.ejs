        <p>Executive orders are directives from the President to federal agencies. They tell departments like Homeland Security, the EPA, or the IRS what to prioritize, how to enforce existing laws, or what policies to adopt. They can change how the government operates without needing a vote from Congress. This site helps you keep track of what's been signed and explains what each order actually means.</p>
